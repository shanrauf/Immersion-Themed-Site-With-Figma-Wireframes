      Finding the time and energy to learn a foreign language isn’t easy. It’s
      no surprise that most language learning products try to lure in customers
      by advertising that “you’ll be speaking from day one” or “you’ll reach
      fluency with only minutes of effort per day.” But, even the slightest
      amount of critical thinking reveals the absurdity of these claims.
    </p>
    Human language contains tens of thousands of words, relies on a profoundly
    complicated system of grammar, and is generally spoken faster than two words
    per second. Even the most basic linguistic activities—such as chatting with
    a friend—require your brain to instantaneously parse and manipulate language
    with a high level of accuracy. In other words, speaking a language is no
    easy feat. Spending time actively studying vocabulary and grammar
    <i>is</i> helpful when learning a language. But, in order to keep up with
    raw native speech, you'll have to install an entirely new operating system
    onto your brain’s hard drive. And realistically, the only way that is ever
    going to happen is through mass exposure to the language. In other words,
    <strong>immersion</strong>. But, don’t let the word “immersion” intimidate
    you. While it is true that most people underestimate how long it takes to
    learn a language well, they also underestimate how much free time they have
    each day. Thanks to technology and the internet, you can bring your target
    language around with you wherever you go—which means you can keep yourself
    immersed without taking a single step outside your home country. If you
    start listening to your target language whenever you’re commuting, waiting
    in line, or washing the dishes, you may be impressed with how quickly the
    hours rack up. Combine this with an hour or two a day of enjoying TV dramas
    in your target language, and even a busy adult is able to spend a
    surprisingly large amount of time with the language each day.

      most effective path to foreign language proficiency.</strong

    This is just as true for those busy with work and family as it is for those
    looking to fully dedicate themselves to acquiring a language. That’s why the
    first major goal of the “<strong>Mass Immersion Approach</strong>” (MIA) is
    to spread awareness of how effective immersion-based learning is. The second
    is to make implementing it as easy as possible—through providing
    comprehensive, straightforward instruction, as well as app-based tools to
    optimize the learning process.

    Matt started learning Japanese around the middle of 2011. Using an
    immersion-based method called "<a

      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >All Japanese All the Time</a
    >" (AJATT)—combined with three years of near full-time dedication—he was
    able to reach a high level of Japanese fluency. But, he still wasn’t
    satisfied. Wanting to reduce the gap he felt between himself and native
    speakers, Matt continued to intensively study Japanese. Although AJATT had
    worked great for reaching a comfortable level of fluency, it had little to
    say about how to continue improving past that point. This led Matt to test
    out other techniques, and begin thinking more critically about how language
    acquisition really worked. After an additional two years of study,
    experimentation and discovery, he finally reached
    <a
      href="https://youtu.be/SrHwPv7gUCE"
      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >a level of ability he’s proud of</a
    >. Besides a six month period he spent in Japan in 2012, Matt learned
    Japanese entirely within the United States. Fast-forward two years, during
    the latter part of 2017 Matt created an online community based around AJATT.
    The method’s original creator had long disappeared from the internet, and in
    his absence, Matt quickly became known as AJATT’s ambassador. Working
    closely with other Japanese learners, Matt continued to improve upon the
    original method. Over time, significant differences arose between the
    “original” AJATT method, and Matt’s modified version. Eventually, Matt
    realized that in order to have his views on language learning reach the
    largest audience possible, an entirely new platform was needed. This
    ultimately led to the birth of MIA. Matt is in charge of creating most of
    MIA’s written and video-based content, although he also works very closely
    with Yoga to design MIA’s app-based tools and resources.

    Lucas—known online as Yoga—grew up in Brazil, but was later adopted by an
    American family and moved to America when he was nine. He stepped off the
    plane not knowing a word of English. But, within a few years of arriving, he
    was undeniably speaking native level English. In return, he ended up
    completely forgetting Portuguese. As a result, Yoga was left with a strong
    desire to once again become bilingual—which led him to begin learning
    Japanese in 2009. His experience learning English had taught him that
    immersion was the key to language acquisition. After finding further
    inspiration in ideas such as Krashen’s Input Hypothesis, AJATT, and Steve
    Kaufmann’s input-based learning strategies, Yoga began an intensive dive
    into Japanese. By the time he moved to Japan two years later, Yoga had
    become fluent in the language. And after an additional year of intensive
    study in the country, he was comfortably in the top 1% of foreign Japanese
    speakers. But, his life as a language learner was just getting started. Long
    story short—4 years of travel and study later—Yoga was fluent in Mandarin
    and Portuguese as well. During that time, he also dabbled in a smattering of
    other languages, including Korean, Arabic, and German, among others.
    Throughout Yoga’s time learning languages, he found that gathering the
    necessary resources to effectively learn languages often required absurd
    amounts of compromise and menial work. A desire to improve this situation
    for future learners, along with an inherent interest, led Yoga’s primary
    focus to fully shift from languages to programming. Today, 4 years later, he
    considers himself “fluent” in code—although he is still striving towards
    “native level”. Yoga develops all of MIA’s app-based tools and resources,
    but also works closely with Matt to plan out MIA’s written and video-based
    content.
    <h1>The Plan</h1>
    Matt and Yoga began working together to create MIA soon after they met in
    2018. In a way, it was the natural conclusion of their shared views on
    language learning and complementary skill set. The name “MIA” is a play on
    words, as when one fully immerses themselves in their target language, they
    temporarily become “missing in action” from the world of their mother
    tongue. The word “approach” was chosen over “method,” as the broader, more
    flexible connotation better represents what Matt and Yoga set out to create:
    something that can be easily customized to allow language learners to reach
    a wide range of different goals, from basic fluency to native level. The
    final vision for MIA is twofold: First—a series of self-contained articles
    that, when consumed in chronological order, will equip learners with
    everything they need to understand and apply the most efficient language
    acquisition techniques. Topics ranging from language acquisition theory, to
    psychology and motivation, to the nitty-gritty of obtaining media and
    creating flashcards, will all be explained in clear and straightforward
    language. And second—an extensive toolkit of apps and programs that help
    learners automate and optimize the language learning process. At the current
    moment MIA is still brand new, and the majority of the content has not been
    created yet. What has been created can be found on the
    <a href="/table-of-contents/">table of contents</a>. You can also check the
    <a href="/updates/">updates</a> page for a list of the most recent content.

    When it comes to language acquisition, we still don't have all the answers;
    experimentation and feedback from community members is crucial for MIA’s
    further development. Of course, financial support through

    on MIA. However, simply by using MIA to acquire a foreign language, you’re
    putting yourself in a position where you can provide us valuable feedback
    about how to improve the approach. Not to mention that, once you succeed,
    you will serve as living proof for MIA whenever you give an honest answer to
    &nbsp;the question: "How did you become so fluent?" 😉
