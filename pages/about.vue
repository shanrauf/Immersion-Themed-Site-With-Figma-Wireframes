      <p>
        Finding the time and energy to learn a foreign language isn’t easy. It’s
        no surprise that most language learning products try to lure in
        customers by advertising that “you’ll be speaking from day one” or
        “you’ll reach fluency with only minutes of effort per day.” But, even
        the slightest amount of critical thinking reveals the absurdity of these
        claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        Human language contains tens of thousands of words, relies on a
        profoundly complicated system of grammar, and is generally spoken faster
        than two words per second. Even the most basic linguistic
        activities—such as chatting with a friend—require your brain to
        instantaneously parse and manipulate language with a high level of
        accuracy. In other words, speaking a language is no easy feat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Spending time actively studying vocabulary and grammar
        <i>is</i> helpful when learning a language. But, in order to keep up
        with raw native speech, you'll have to install an entirely new operating
        system onto your brain’s hard drive. And realistically, the only way
        that is ever going to happen is through mass exposure to the language.
        In other words, <strong>immersion</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        But, don’t let the word “immersion” intimidate you. While it is true
        that most people underestimate how long it takes to learn a language
        well, they also underestimate how much free time they have each day.
        Thanks to technology and the internet, you can bring your target
        language around with you wherever you go—which means you can keep
        yourself immersed without taking a single step outside your home
        country.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you start listening to your target language whenever you’re
        commuting, waiting in line, or washing the dishes, you may be impressed
        with how quickly the hours rack up. Combine this with an hour or two a
        day of enjoying TV dramas in your target language, and even a busy adult
        is able to spend a surprisingly large amount of time with the language
        each day.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Immersion—combined with optimized study through spaced repetition—is
          the most effective path to foreign language proficiency.</strong
        >
        This is just as true for those busy with work and family as it is for
        those looking to fully dedicate themselves to acquiring a language.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why the first major goal of the “<strong
          >Mass Immersion Approach</strong
        >” (MIA) is to spread awareness of how effective immersion-based
        learning is. The second is to make implementing it as easy as
        possible—through providing comprehensive, straightforward instruction,
        as well as app-based tools to optimize the learning process.
      </p>

      <h1>The Team</h1>
      <h2>Matt</h2>
      <img src="~/assets/Matt-400.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="400" />

      <p>
        Matt started learning Japanese around the middle of 2011. Using an
        immersion-based method called "<nuxt-link
          to="https://youtu.be/ugrOTjzLTYk"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >All Japanese All the Time</nuxt-link
        >" (AJATT)—combined with three years of near full-time dedication—he was
        able to reach a high level of Japanese fluency. But, he still wasn’t
        satisfied.
      </p>

      <p>
        Wanting to reduce the gap he felt between himself and native speakers,
        Matt continued to intensively study Japanese. Although AJATT had worked
        great for reaching a comfortable level of fluency, it had little to say
        about how to continue improving past that point. This led Matt to test
        out other techniques, and begin thinking more critically about how
        language acquisition really worked.
      </p>

      <p>
        After an additional two years of study, experimentation and discovery,
        he finally reached
        <nuxt-link
          to="https://youtu.be/SrHwPv7gUCE"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >a level of ability he’s proud of</nuxt-link
        >. Besides a six month period he spent in Japan in 2012, Matt learned
        Japanese entirely within the United States.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fast-forward two years, during the latter part of 2017 Matt created an
        online community based around AJATT. The method’s original creator had
        long disappeared from the internet, and in his absence, Matt quickly
        became known as AJATT’s ambassador. Working closely with other Japanese
        learners, Matt continued to improve upon the original method. Over time,
        significant differences arose between the “original” AJATT method, and
        Matt’s modified version. Eventually, Matt realized that in order to have
        his views on language learning reach the largest audience possible, an
        entirely new platform was needed. This ultimately led to the birth of
        MIA.
      </p>

      <p>
        Matt is in charge of creating most of MIA’s written and video-based
        content, although he also works very closely with Yoga to design MIA’s
        app-based tools and resources.
      </p>

      <h2>Yoga</h2>
      <img src="~/assets/Yoga.png" alt="Yoga" width="344" height="473" />

      <p>
        Lucas—known online as Yoga—grew up in Brazil, but was later adopted by
        an American family and moved to America when he was nine. He stepped off
        the plane not knowing a word of English. But, within a few years of
        arriving, he was undeniably speaking native level English. In return, he
        ended up completely forgetting Portuguese.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a result, Yoga was left with a strong desire to once again become
        bilingual—which led him to begin learning Japanese in 2009. His
        experience learning English had taught him that immersion was the key to
        language acquisition. After finding further inspiration in ideas such as
        Krashen’s Input Hypothesis, AJATT, and Steve Kaufmann’s input-based
        learning strategies, Yoga began an intensive dive into Japanese.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the time he moved to Japan two years later, Yoga had become fluent in
        the language. And after an additional year of intensive study in the
        country, he was comfortably in the top 1% of foreign Japanese speakers.
        But, his life as a language learner was just getting started.
      </p>

      <p>
        Long story short—4 years of travel and study later—Yoga was fluent in
        Mandarin and Portuguese as well. During that time, he also dabbled in a
        smattering of other languages, including Korean, Arabic, and German,
        among others.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout Yoga’s time learning languages, he found that gathering the
        necessary resources to effectively learn languages often required absurd
        amounts of compromise and menial work. A desire to improve this
        situation for future learners, along with an inherent interest, led
        Yoga’s primary focus to fully shift from languages to programming.
        Today, 4 years later, he considers himself “fluent” in code—although he
        is still striving towards “native level”.
      </p>

      <p>
        Yoga develops all of MIA’s app-based tools and resources, but also works
        closely with Matt to plan out MIA’s written and video-based content.
      </p>

      <h1>The Plan</h1>
      <p>
        Matt and Yoga began working together to create MIA soon after they met
        in 2018. In a way, it was the natural conclusion of their shared views
        on language learning and complementary skill set.
      </p>

      <p>
        The name “MIA” is a play on words, as when one fully immerses themselves
        in their target language, they temporarily become “missing in action”
        from the world of their mother tongue. The word “approach” was chosen
        over “method,” as the broader, more flexible connotation better
        represents what Matt and Yoga set out to create: something that can be
        easily customized to allow language learners to reach a wide range of
        different goals, from basic fluency to native level.
      </p>

      <p>
        The final vision for MIA is twofold:
      </p>

      <p>
        First—a series of self-contained articles that, when consumed in
        chronological order, will equip learners with everything they need to
        understand and apply the most efficient language acquisition techniques.
        Topics ranging from language acquisition theory, to psychology and
        motivation, to the nitty-gritty of obtaining media and creating
        flashcards, will all be explained in clear and straightforward language.
      </p>

      <p>
        And second—an extensive toolkit of apps and programs that help learners
        automate and optimize the language learning process.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the current moment MIA is still brand new, and the majority of the
        content has not been created yet. What has been created can be found on
        the <nuxt-link to="/table-of-contents/">table of contents</nuxt-link>.

      <h1>We Need Your Help</h1>
      <p>
        When it comes to language acquisition, we still don't have all the
        answers; experimentation and feedback from community members is crucial
        for MIA’s further development.

        is greatly appreciated. Ultimately, it’s what allows us to continue
        working on MIA. However, simply by using MIA to acquire a foreign
        language, you’re putting yourself in a position where you can provide us
        valuable feedback about how to improve the approach.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not to mention that, once you succeed, you will serve as living proof
        for MIA whenever you give an honest answer to &nbsp;the question: "How
        did you become so fluent?" 😉
