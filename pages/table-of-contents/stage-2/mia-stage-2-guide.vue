                  The following guide provides the basic instructions necessary
                  to complete MIA Stage 2 for any major language. It’s mainly
                  focused on <i>what to do</i> and less on <i>why to do it</i>.

                  This guide assumes a basic understanding of the concepts and
                  terms presented in MIA Stage 1. Although a MIA Stage 1 Guide
                  currently doesn’t exist, the

                  provides virtually all of the necessary information to
                  complete Stage 1 for any major language. If you’re learning a
                  language other than Japanese, simply ignore the
                  Japanese-specific topics included in the Quickstart Guide.

                <p>
                  Throughout this guide, we will be making considerable use of
                  the following terms:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    TL subs – Target language subtitles.
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Note—immersing with TL subbed media is technically a
                        hybrid activity, being a form of both listening and
                        reading. However, it is much closer to reading than
                        listening; therefore, it is generally considered a form
                        of<b> reading</b> for the purposes of MIA.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Throughout this guide, we will be focusing on immersion
                        with TL subbed audio/visual content (e.g. television).
                        Despite this, the same principles apply to any form of
                        listening while following along with a transcript.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    NL subs – Native language subtitles (not necessarily your
                    true native language, but rather a language you already
                    understand).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Raw text – Written content that contains little to no audio
                    or visual component. TL subbed content is
                    <strong>not</strong> considered raw text.

                <h2>Introduction: Why Create a Stage 2 Guide Now?</h2>
                <p>
                  At the current time of publication, an MIA Stage 1 guide
                  doesn’t exist. So, why did we decide to make the Stage 2 guide
                  first?
                </p>
                <p>
                  In September 2019, we released the “MIA Japanese Quickstart
                  Guide.” As the name suggests, the idea behind the guide was to
                  present the minimum amount of information that a beginner
                  needs to start learning Japanese with MIA. Instead, it ended
                  up becoming a comprehensive guide for progressing through MIA
                  Stage 1 as a Japanese learner. The guide was positively
                  received, so we thought to create similar guides for other
                  major languages.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once we started working on this, we realized that making
                  separate full-length guides for each language would be a
                  redundant way of creating key MIA content. Instead, we decided
                  to disperse the information across the following three
                  categories of content:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <b>Stage-Specific Guides</b>—explaining how to follow each
                    Stage of MIA, without diving too deeply into language
                    acquisition theory.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Language-Specific Guides</b>—providing instruction and
                    resources unique to specific languages.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <b>Language Acquisition Theory Content</b>—going further
                    in-depth on various language acquisition theory and related
                    topics that enhance your understanding of how to learn a
                    language. At the present moment, the
                    <a
                      href="https://www.youtube.com/user/MATTvsJapan"
                      target="_blank"
                      rel="noopener"
                      >Matt vs. Japan YouTube channel</a
                    >
                    is the best source for this type of information.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Deciding on this new direction naturally means that we will
                  have to convert the current “MIA Japanese Quickstart Guide”
                  into a new general “MIA Stage 1 Guide.” We have decided to
                  postpone that for the following two reasons:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    The Japanese Quickstart Guide can already function as a
                    working Stage 1 Guide. The bulk of the information contained
                    in it is applicable to any language. So, even if you’re not
                    learning Japanese, you can still benefit from it simply by
                    ignoring the Japanese-specific details.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Many MIA practitioners have completed Stage 1 and are hungry
                    for Stage 2 guidance.
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                  So, in order to best meet current demands, we’ve decided to
                  delay converting the Japanese Quickstart Guide in favor of
                  getting the Stage 2 Guide out as soon as possible. We
                  apologize for any inconveniences that this may cause.
                </p>
                <h1 id="stage-2">Stage 2 at a Glance</h1>
                <p>
                  Stage 2 is largely a continuation of Stage 1. In Stage 1, you
                  started off by learning the basic phonology, writing system,
                  grammar, and vocabulary of your target language. You then
                  transitioned to learning directly from native media in the
                  form of sentence cards. Of course, this was all alongside
                  immersing yourself in native content in order to integrate
                  what you consciously learned and begin internalizing the
                  language on an unconscious level.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This was all for the purpose of building a foundation in
                  <i>understanding </i>your target language. In Stage 2, you’ll
                  continue to increase your capacity to understand by doing, for
                  the most part, more of the same: immersion and sentence
                  mining. The nature of how you immerse and the strategies you
                  employ to mine sentences will shift, but the underlying
                  structure will stay the same. The more words you learn and the
                  more quality time you spend with your target language, the
                  more your comprehension will grow.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One major point of Stage 2 is further developing your reading
                  skill, with the goal of moving into reading raw text. The
                  <b>Immersion </b>and <b>SRS </b>sections will help you
                  accomplish this.
                </p>
                <p>
                  There is also the monolingual transition, perhaps the most
                  notable change that Stage 2 brings. The monolingual transition
                  is the process of transitioning to learning your target
                  language <i>in your target language</i>, without relying on
                  your native language. This transition will radically
                  accelerate the growth rate of your comprehension. The
                  <b>Monolingual Transition</b> section will explain everything
                  you need to know to make the transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By the end of Stage 2, you should be able to understand enough
                  of your target language to comfortably survive in a country
                  where the language is spoken. There should be some basic
                  content, such as slice-of-life TV shows or internet blogs,
                  that you’re close to being able to fully understand. This
                  opens up the possibility of learning to speak and write the
                  language in a natural way, which will be explored in Stage 3.
                </p>
                <h3>How Do I Know I’m Ready for Stage 2?</h3>
                <p>Here are some basic criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You have a firm grasp of your target language’s phonology
                    and writing system.
                  </li>
                  <li>You know at least ~3,000 words.</li>
                  <li>
                    No matter what you are listening to, you can usually
                    understand at least one word in every sentence spoken.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    When listening to basic spoken content (such as talking-head
                    YouTube videos or slice-of-life TV shows) you can usually
                    understand at least 50% of the words in most sentences, and
                    fully understand a longer sentence around once every few
                    minutes.
                  </li>

                    When consuming basic written content (such as blogs or
                    simple TV shows w/ TL subs) you’re often able to follow the
                    basic ideas being expressed (although you may miss many
                    details).

                  That said, ultimately, it’s not important to make a razor
                  sharp distinction between Stage 1 and Stage 2. Regardless of
                  the criteria listed above, feel free to begin gradually
                  transitioning to Stage 2 whenever you feel it might be a good
                  idea to do so. If you find yourself struggling with a Stage 2
                  technique, simply return to the Stage 1 equivalent and try
                  again in a month or two. There’s no harm in trying.

                  Although immersion is constant throughout every Stage of MIA,
                  the specifics of how you immerse will vary as you move from
                  stage to stage. During Stage 2, you will begin introducing raw
                  text into your immersion. At this point, understanding the
                  relationship between listening ability and reading ability
                  becomes important.&nbsp;

                <p>
                  When it comes to understanding a foreign language, listening
                  comprehension is generally much harder than reading
                  comprehension. This is because:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    You need to be able to process language at the rate of
                    speech.

                  <li>
                    Native pronunciation tends to be inconsistent and mumbly.

                </ul>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, when reading, you can take as long as you
                  like, and written words appear in consistent and predictable
                  forms.

                  Additionally, not only is act of reading inherently easier
                  than listening, but it’s also easier to learn from. It allows
                  for swift word look-ups with pop-up dictionaries and easy Anki
                  card creation through copy/pasting. In contrast, learning from
                  listening usually requires you to correctly hear words and
                  manually look them up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because of these advantages, focusing on reading is a highly
                  effective strategy for rapid improvement. What happens with
                  this strategy is that your reading ability ends up developing
                  past your listening ability, and then that reading ability is
                  subsequently transferred into listening ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When your reading ability develops past your listening
                  ability, catching your listening back up usually isn’t too
                  difficult. The reason for this is that learning to hear a
                  word/structure that you can already read is much easier than
                  learning a new word/structure entirely through listening. What
                  happens is that, as long as you continue to actively and
                  passively listen to the language, any reading ability you have
                  will eventually transfer over to listening ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Recall that in Stage 1 we recommended following a
                  listening-to-reading ratio of 1:1 for active immersion (i.e.,
                  dividing your active immersion time equally between the two
                  activities). This allowed the two abilities to work together
                  harmoniously, with reading informing your listening, and vice
                  versa. However, because reading ability is inherently easier
                  to develop than listening ability, some amount of gap should
                  have formed between the two by the end of Stage 1.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to utilize the strategy mentioned above, going
                  forward, we recommend maintaining this gap between reading and
                  listening ability. Do so by continuing to stick near the 1:1
                  listening-to-reading ratio, especially while you’re still near
                  the beginning of Stage 2.&nbsp;

                  Disadvantages of a Large Gap Between Reading and Listening
                  Ability
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Although letting your reading ability develop past your
                  listening ability is a powerful strategy for rapid progress,
                  allowing the gap between the two to grow too large can have
                  negative consequences.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first potential negative consequence of letting the gap
                  become too big is that active listening itself may become
                  tedious and painful.&nbsp;For example, let’s say someone
                  devoted most of their energy into reading while largely
                  neglecting active listening. This person would naturally end
                  up with highly developed ready ability and rather poor
                  listening ability. Once this happened, they would likely
                  become accustomed to understanding most of their immersion. In
                  turn, this may lead them to experience tedium and frustration
                  when faced with how little they understand when listening. We
                  can imagine them going on to avoid active listening
                  altogether, which would cause the gap to grow even larger.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The second potential negative consequence of letting the gap
                  between listening and reading ability grow too big is that it
                  may harm your pronunciation. This is because, even during
                  silent reading, you pronounce everything you read with a voice
                  inside your head (a.k.a.
                  <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subvocalization"

                  >).
                </p>
                <p>
                  The issue is that, before your listening abilities are fully
                  developed, it’s impossible to grasp the way a language should
                  sound. This means that, while reading raw text,&nbsp;your
                  subvocalization will inevitably be filled with
                  mispronunciations and unnatural intonation patterns. If you
                  read excessively without listening ability to back it up (in
                  other words,
                  <i>while you have a large listening/reading ability gap</i>),
                  these inaccuracies could lead to you internalize bad habits
                  that will manifest when you eventually start speaking your
                  target language.

                  When Should I Be Worried about My Listening/Reading Ability
                  Gap?
                </h3>
                <p>
                  Our stance is that your gap is likely within a safe margin
                  when these two statements are true:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Listening always comprises a significant portion of your
                    active immersion; and therefore, your listening ability is
                    <b>constantly improving</b>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Your listening/reading ability gap doesn’t cause you
                    noticeable pain or frustration during active listening
                    immersion. If even just this statement is true, it’s
                    unlikely that your gap is too large.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  The key logic here is that if your listening ability is
                  constantly improving, then your <b>internal model</b> of how
                  the language sounds is being <b>regularly updated</b>. Due to
                  the constant updating, it’s unlikely that your subvocalized
                  pronunciation would become stagnant enough for ingrained
                  habits to form.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It is worth emphasizing that if listening doesn’t make up some
                  significant portion of your active immersion, then the margin
                  of safety will <b>decrease </b>in your case due to the logic
                  stated above.
                </p>
                <h3>Conclusion: Listening Ability vs. Reading Ability</h3>
                <p>
                  To summarize, letting your listening ability lag behind your
                  reading ability is generally the most effective strategy for
                  rapid improvement. That said, it’s important not to neglect
                  listening throughout the process, as letting your listening
                  ability get too far behind has negative consequences.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over time, you will naturally develop an intuition for what
                  the ideal gap size is between listening and reading ability.
                  Once this begins to happen, you can start regularly shifting
                  your listening-to reading ratio in order to maintain that
                  ideal gap size. For example, if you feel your listening
                  ability is starting to lag a little too far behind your
                  reading ability, you can decide to decrease your reading time
                  and increase your active listening time for the following few
                  weeks.&nbsp;

                <h3>NL (Native Language) Subs</h3>
                <p>
                  In Stage 1, we said that it’s fine to start immersing in your
                  target language with NL subs (native language subtitles).
                  Because jumping straight into immersion can initially feel
                  jarring and intimidating, watching with NL subs can be a
                  useful way to get accustomed to spending time with your target
                  language.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With that said, immersing with NL subs is
                  <b>relatively low quality immersion</b>, equivalent to passive
                  listening at best. Put simply, if you’re reading subtitles,
                  then you’re not fully paying attention to the audio. This is
                  why it’s important to wean yourself off of NL subs once you
                  have gotten into the habit of immersing yourself in your
                  target language. If you haven’t already, we recommend fully
                  weaning yourself off NL subs before starting Stage 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Some people take the strategy of generally watching without
                  subtitles, and pausing to look at NL subs only when they don’t
                  understand something or want to double check. This technique
                  is clearly a large step up from immersing with NL subs on the
                  entire time, as the amount of time you spend in unmediated
                  contact with your target language is vastly increased. That
                  being said, it still comes with some of its own problems.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first of these is that looking at NL subs will
                  <b>bias the way you interpret your target language</b>. No
                  matter how skillful the translator, ultimately, every
                  translation is imperfect. Every language contains unique
                  nuances and subtleties that simply cannot be fully translated
                  into another language. Additionally, translators often
                  prioritize creating subtitles that are easy to follow for the
                  intended audience, rather than 1:1 translations of meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because of this, reading NL subs may lead you to draw
                  <b>false equivalencies</b> between words, structures, and
                  phrases. For example, you might pick out a target language
                  word in your immersion and equate it to a word you saw in the
                  NL subtitles, when in reality the two have slightly different
                  nuances. Once internalized, these sorts of false equivalencies
                  can be hard to overcome, and can lead to using the language in
                  unnatural ways later down the line.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The other, less obvious, pitfall of using NL subs to clear up
                  confusion is that it can interfere with cultivating a
                  <b>tolerance for ambiguity</b>. “Tolerating ambiguity” means
                  being okay with not fully understanding the plot of a show or
                  the meaning of a word or structure. It means being able to
                  trust the process, knowing that blurry understandings will
                  naturally become clear over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Growing your capacity to tolerate ambiguity is essential to
                  making rapid progress. Unfortunately, tolerating ambiguity
                  often doesn’t come naturally. Most of us have grown up in a
                  culture that places a lot of value on “understanding things.”
                  Because of this, for most people, being able to tolerate
                  ambiguity is a skill that must be actively cultivated over
                  time. And it’s not hard to see how looking at NL subs every
                  time you don’t understand something slows down this
                  cultivation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although watching with NL subs is something that you should
                  have completely left behind before moving into Stage 2, in the
                  initial phase of Stage 2, it’s okay to use the strategy of
                  turning them on only when you don’t understand something. But,
                  try to rely on NL subs as little as possible, and slowly wean
                  yourself off using them in any form as you progress through
                  Stage 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The same advice goes for bilingual texts and any other content
                  that revolves around learning through translated material. One
                  of the main goals of Stage 2 is to become able to learn your
                  target language
                  <strong>entirely in your target language</strong>, without
                  using your native language as a crutch.

                <h3>TL (Target Language) Subtitles</h3>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, we also have TL subs (target language
                  subtitles). In Stage 1, we recommended watching TL subbed
                  content as an effective way to become acquainted with the
                  written form of your target language. When you’re a beginner
                  and don’t yet know a lot of words, audio-visual mediums are
                  inherently more comprehensible than raw text mediums like
                  books or articles. TL subbed content lets you take advantage
                  of the comprehensibility of audio-visual mediums to help get
                  your foot in the door of reading.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Though we often consider watching TL subbed content as a form
                  of reading, ultimately, is a hybrid of both reading and
                  listening. When watching with TL subs, your reading ability
                  helps fill in gaps in your listening ability, and vice versa.
                  Because of this, you’re likely to understand significantly
                  more than when either watching with no subs, or when reading
                  raw text. This is great in the beginning of the language
                  acquisition process; when you first start out, understanding
                  anything at all is extremely difficult, and you need all the
                  help you can get. That said, once you start to become more
                  advanced, watching with TL subs can become a crutch.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Something we explained in Stage 1 is that because watching
                  with TL subs is closer to reading than listening, in order to
                  fully develop your listening skills,
                  <b
                    >it’s important to spend large amounts of time actively
                    listening without any subtitles</b
                  >. The reason for this is that the hardest part of listening
                  comprehension is determining what words are being spoken from
                  sound alone. When watching with TL subs, what words are being
                  spoken are presented to you right there on the screen. Thus,
                  watching with TL subs doesn’t provide your brain with an
                  opportunity to practice that crucial skill of determining what
                  words are being said just from sound.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ultimately, the same is true for reading as well. When
                  listening to spoken language, intonation and stress make it
                  relatively easy to parse the grammar of what is being said. On
                  the other hand, when reading, you don’t have any intonation to
                  rely on, and this can make parsing the grammar much more
                  difficult.
                </p>
                <p>For example, take the following sentence:</p>
                <blockquote class="bq">
                  <p>
                    <a
                      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden-path_sentence#Examples"
                      target="_blank"
                      rel="noopener"
                      >“The complex houses married and single soldiers and their
                      families.”</a
                    >
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  If this sentence was spoken out loud, the intonation would
                  make it easy to understand. But in written form, figuring out
                  how to parse the grammar is quite difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If the only reading practice you got is watching TL subbed
                  content, you would never get practice parsing syntax without
                  the help of intonation. Because of this, as you progress
                  through Stage 2,
                  <b
                    >we recommend slowly replacing watching TL subbed content
                    with reading raw text.</b
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  In real life, most everyday linguistic situations require us
                  to be able to listen without relying on our eyes, and read
                  without relying on our ears. Because of this, the most
                  efficient way to meaningfully grow your language ability is to
                  practice doing just that:
                  <b
                    >listening without a transcript, and reading without
                    audio.</b
                  >
                </p>
                <h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>
                <h3>Reading Raw Text Is Difficult</h3>
                <p>
                  As explained above, once you transition into Stage 2, we
                  recommend gradually moving away from watching TL subbed
                  content, <b>towards reading raw text</b> (fully text-based
                  mediums) instead. But, breaking into reading raw text can
                  initially be quite intimidating and challenging.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First of all, there is the issue mentioned earlier of having
                  to parse grammar without any help from intonation patterns.
                  This is a skill that takes practice to develop, and will
                  likely be challenging at first.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Second, when reading raw text, because you don’t have any
                  visual or auditory clues to help you, you have nothing but
                  your language ability to rely on. This means that what is
                  required to reach a basic level of comprehension is
                  significantly higher.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Third, when compared to watching with TL subs, reading raw
                  text makes what you <i>don’t know</i> much more distracting
                  and in-your-face. This is because the pacing of audio/visual
                  media is quick and out of your control. In contrast, you can
                  read raw text at any pace you’d like. This makes letting go
                  and tolerating ambiguity much more difficult. As you have
                  probably experienced, it is often very tempting to look up
                  every unknown word or grammar structure in a difficult
                  sentence.
                </p>
                <p>
                  And lastly, in most languages the range of vocabulary used in
                  writing is usually significantly larger than that of spoken
                  language. For example, take the English words “astonishing,”
                  “astounding,” “spectacular,” “phenomenal,” “miraculous,” and
                  “breathtaking.” These are all words that appear relatively
                  frequently in formal written English. Although these words are
                  occasionally used in spoken English as well, within the
                  context of normal everyday conversation, it’s much more common
                  to simply say “awesome” or “cool.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  When watching content with TL subs, you’re essentially
                  exposing yourself to
                  <b>a written form of the spoken language</b>. Because of this,
                  when you initially make the jump from watching TL subbed
                  content to reading raw text, you’re likely to find that the
                  percentage of unknown words dramatically increases. This is
                  perhaps the largest obstacle of learning to read raw text.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, although we argue that ultimately reading is easier than
                  listening, becoming proficient in reading raw text comes with
                  its own set of unique challenges. Being aware of these
                  challenges, and setting your expectations accordingly, is one
                  of the keys to successfully breaking into raw text.
                </p>
                <h3>Avoid Feeling You Need to Be “Ready”</h3>
                <p>
                  Here is a trap that many people fall into. Coming out of Stage
                  1, their immersion consists of solely audio and audio/visual
                  content, with and without TL subs. They have reached a point
                  where they’re relatively comfortable with certain TL subbed
                  content, and decide it might be time to transition into raw
                  text. So, they pick up a book they have always wanted to read
                  and jump right in.
                </p>
                <p>
                  They are then immediately confronted with the brute reality of
                  how much more difficult books are. This causes them to quickly
                  give up and return to audio/visual content, concluding that
                  “they aren’t ready for reading books yet.” After a few more
                  months of immersing with audio/visual content, they eventually
                  try the book again, only to find it just as inapproachable as
                  before. They end up repeating this process indefinitely,
                  perpetually postponing the jump into reading raw text.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The problem here is that, in a certain sense, you will never
                  be “ready” for raw text until <strong>after </strong>you have
                  spent a significant amount of time grappling with it. In other
                  words, if you wait until you can <i>already </i>ride a bike
                  before taking off the training wheels, you’ll never become
                  able to ride a bike; the process of learning to ride a bike
                  begins <strong>after</strong> the training wheels are removed.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The challenges of reading that were explored above are only
                  found within raw text, so the only way to build the skills
                  necessary to overcome them is through
                  <strong>actually reading raw text</strong>. No matter how long
                  you wait, the first book you ever read will always be
                  extremely difficult. But, after finishing that first book, the
                  next one won’t feel nearly as difficult.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now, to a certain extent, it’s most definitely true that it’s
                  important to have a solid foundation in the language before
                  venturing into raw text. So, in many cases, concluding that
                  you aren’t ready yet may indeed be the right decision. But,
                  keep in mind that the foundation necessary to jump into raw
                  text is likely much less than you initially expect,&nbsp;and
                  be wary of falling into the trap mentioned above.
                </p>
                <h3>Getting Started with Raw Text</h3>
                <p>
                  When getting started with raw text, there is no need to go
                  from 0-to-100 . Many of the struggles stated above can be
                  avoided by easing your way into raw text in a strategic way.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First of all, we recommend starting off with content that
                  contains grammar and vocabulary similar to that of spoken
                  language. Some good examples are: YouTube comments, blogs,
                  comic books/graphic novels/manga, and movie/TV show
                  transcripts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another good option is TL subs: if you have access to TL
                  subtitle files, you can treat them as raw text and read them
                  on their own. The
                  <a
                    href="https://subtitletools.com/convert-subtitles-to-plain-text-online"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener"
                    >Subtitle Tools website</a
                  >
                  can come in handy here as it allows you to convert subtitle
                  files into plain text. Consider reading the transcripts of
                  shows that you have already seen before; because you already
                  know the basic plot, it will be easier to follow the text.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When initially approaching raw text, it may be a good idea to
                  start with something as simple as spending 5 minutes a day
                  attempting to understand the comments on a target language
                  YouTube video. As you get more comfortable, you can gradually
                  increase the amount of time you spend reading raw text each
                  day.&nbsp;
                </p>
                <p>
                  As your skills develop, try to move from things like comic
                  books and blogs towards more challenging content, such as news
                  articles or text-heavy video games.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Eventually, by the end of Stage 2, your goal should be to
                  tackle the holy grail of reading: books. Books, both
                  nonfiction and fiction, comprise the highest possible quality
                  of reading immersion.

                <h3>Tips for Getting into Books</h3>
                <p>
                  As mentioned above, chances are that no matter how much you
                  prepare, the first book you ever read in your target language
                  will likely be quite challenging. That said, here is an
                  assortment of tips to help you through it:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    For your first book, consider choosing a novel that has been
                    adapted into either a movie or TV show, and watch the
                    adaptation before reading the novel. This way, you will
                    already know the basic plot and characters, which will help
                    keep you from becoming entirely lost while reading.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Consider reading eBooks rather than paper books. When using
                    an eReader, you can easily look up words by simply pressing
                    on them. Because you will likely be looking up many words
                    while reading your first few books, using an eReader can
                    make a big difference.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Try reading multiple books by the same author. Each author
                    tends to have a unique writing style and set of vocabulary
                    they regularly use. If you read multiple books by the same
                    author, you will become accustomed to that author’s specific
                    writing style, allowing you to gain a solid foothold in
                    reading books in a shorter amount of time.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Choose Reading Material That Interests You</h3>
                <p>
                  The last, and perhaps most important thing to mention when it
                  comes to breaking into raw text, is to always choose the
                  material that you are intrinsically interested in.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Reading raw text is going to feel tough for a while, so
                  forcing yourself to read something boring is unlikely to be a
                  sustainable strategy. On the other hand, if you genuinely find
                  what you’re reading compelling, it probably won’t be hard to
                  continue moving forward despite any difficulties you run
                  into.&nbsp;Said another way,
                  <strong
                    >you’re likely to have more success working through
                    something that’s above your level but genuinely compelling,
                    than something that’s perfect for your level but
                    boring</strong
                  >.

                  Forcing yourself to slog through boring immersion material is
                  a slippery slope, as it can lead “spending time with your
                  target language” to become associated with boredom in your
                  head. Once this happens, conjuring up the motivation to
                  regularly immerse will require an iron will, and burnout will
                  become extremely likely. So, when in doubt, simply follow your
                  interests over everything else.

                  On a similar note, although books do tend to give you the most
                  bang for your buck when it comes to reading ability gains,
                  there’s no need to limit yourself to reading nothing but
                  books. It’s also a good idea to regularly mix things up,
                  consuming things like articles, comic books, and video games
                  in between reading books. Not only will this keep things
                  fresh, but it will also help you develop a sense of how your
                  target language is used differently across various domains.

                <h3>The Nitty-Gritty of Reading Raw Text</h3>
                <p>
                  When initially approaching raw text, it’s especially crucial
                  to be <strong>tolerant of ambiguity</strong>. Things are
                  inevitably going to be blurry at first, but they will
                  gradually become clear over time. If a sentence doesn’t click
                  after 15 seconds of grappling with it, then it wasn’t meant to
                  be; simply let it go and move on. The best thing you can do is
                  simply keep on moving. <b>Quantity is key </b>when it comes to
                  gaining footing in raw text.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One common question people often have is, “how often should I
                  look things up while reading?” The following video summarizes
                  our advice on the topic:
                </p>

            data-id="0a37e62"
            data-element_type="widget"
            data-widget_type="text-editor.default"
          >
            <div class="elementor-widget-container">
              <div class="elementor-text-editor elementor-clearfix">
                <p>
                  We should also note that, for the first few books you ever
                  read in your target language, it’s okay to look words up
                  significantly more often than recommended in the above video.
                  For the reasons explained in the above video, once you get
                  over the initial hump, it’s definitely a good idea to become
                  more conservative when it comes to looking things up.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We don’t recommend reading the same material multiple times.
                  It’s true that you will usually understand much more the
                  second time you read a given piece of content. But, this is
                  largely due to what you learned while reading it the first
                  time. You won’t learn nearly as much that second time through,
                  as you will have already picked most of the low-hanging fruit
                  contained within on the first run. Instead, it’s more useful
                  to move on to a new piece of content, where new low-hanging
                  fruit awaits.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, the desire to read the same piece of content
                  multiple times usually stems from perfectionism, i.e., a need
                  to go back and understand what you missed the first time. This
                  is directly opposed to tolerating ambiguity, and usually isn’t
                  very helpful. Instead, it’s more useful to get repetition in
                  the form of reading multiple pieces of content from the same
                  genre or author.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you ever get discouraged, here’s something that might be
                  helpful to think about. When watching audio/visual content,
                  it’s often possible to glean a significant amount of what’s
                  going even without understanding a single word of the
                  language. On the other hand, it’s practically impossible to
                  understand anything at all of raw text without having at least
                  some knowledge of the language. This means that, when reading
                  raw text,
                  <b
                    >every little bit that you understand is due to your own the
                    language ability</b
                  >. When you think about it this way, you may realize that you
                  really aren’t doing so bad.

                <h3>Comprehensibility</h3>
                <p>
                  For the bulk of Stage 1, the goal of listening was to adjust
                  your ears to the sound system of your target language, and
                  begin learning to pick out and understand the most common
                  words and phrases.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Regardless of the specific domain, the sound system and core
                  fundamental vocabulary is present in virtually every form of
                  the spoken language.&nbsp;For example, no matter whether
                  you’re watching a horror movie or listening to the news, all
                  spoken language is made up of the same vowels and consonants,
                  as well as the same basic words, such as “I,” “him,” “there,”
                  and “go” in English. Because of this, when you first start out
                  learning a language, you’re likely to understand a similar
                  amount regardless of what type of content you’re listening to.
                  Because of this, choosing the right immersion content wasn’t
                  important at the time.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But, by the time you reach Stage 2, you will have built up
                  enough of a foundation in your target language to where,
                  depending on the content, it’s actually possible to understand
                  a significant amount while listening. Because of this, it
                  starts to make sense to prioritize comprehensibility when
                  picking immersion material. Let’s go into why.
                </p>
                <h3>Why Comprehensibility is Prioritized</h3>
                <p>
                  Once you hit a critical mass of understanding, learning from
                  immersion becomes significantly easier. For example, let’s say
                  that you’re able to understand around 80% of a given sentence.
                  Assuming that you know the details of the context in which the
                  sentence was spoken, it usually isn’t difficult to fill in the
                  last 20%.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To demonstrate, let’s say you’re watching the following scene:
                  someone walks into a room where another person is playing a
                  guitar and says, “I thought I told you not to **** my ****!”
                  It would be pretty clear that the first “****” must mean
                  “play,” and the second “****” must mean “guitar.” It would be
                  especially easy to draw this connection if you already knew
                  the words “play” and “guitar” through reading, but simply
                  weren’t able to hear them in native speech yet. In this case,
                  after picking out these words from audio alone for the first
                  time, you are likely to become able to pick them out more
                  easily in the future; even in more ambiguous contexts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We might call this type of sentence an “<b
                    >optimal growth sentence</b
                  >.” The more optimal growth sentences that a piece of content
                  contains, the more consuming that content will grow your
                  ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For most of Stage 1, for the reasons explained previously, you
                  are likely to find a similar number of optimal growth
                  sentences regardless of the specific type of content.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But,
                  <b
                    >once you begin approaching Stage 2, you are likely to find
                    certain types of content to contain significantly more
                    optimal growth sentences</b
                  >. Once you reach this stage, focusing most of your active
                  listening on this highly comprehensible content will yield
                  very rapid progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s important to note that the term “comprehensibility” can
                  be thought of <b>ineffectively</b>. Thinking about an entire
                  piece of content as being either “comprehensible” or
                  “incomprehensible” usually isn’t very helpful. Instead, using
                  the framework of “<b
                    >how many of the <i>sentences </i>within this piece of
                    content are optimal growth sentences</b
                  >?” is much more useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, even if a show is largely incomprehensible as a
                  whole, if you end up hearing around one optimal growth
                  sentence a minute, then watching that show will greatly grow
                  your listening ability. When looked at this way,
                  comprehensibility can be seen as a spectrum, rather than a
                  black-or-white judgement.
                </p>
                <h3>
                  How to Choose Immersion Content with Comprehensibility in
                  Mind.
                </h3>
                <p>
                  When talking about breaking into books, we mentioned the
                  time-tested strategy of reading multiple books by the same
                  author as a way to quickly gain a foundation. We can apply a
                  similar strategy to understanding spoken language as well.
                  Listening to content that is largely from the same
                  medium/genre for an extended period of time will lead to you
                  getting familiar with the
                  <b>specific vocabulary and structures</b> commonly used in
                  that domain.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Through this, the comprehensibility of that domain of content
                  will drastically rise, providing you with a platform for
                  accelerating your listening ability. Once you become
                  thoroughly familiar with one domain of speech, branching out
                  to other domains won’t be difficult either.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Additionally, certain mediums and genres are inherently more
                  comprehensible than others. On the level of mediums,<b>
                    any content with a visual component usually has at least a
                    basic level of comprehensibility</b
                  >. Also, fictional content with an ongoing narrative, such as
                  TV dramas, tend to have high levels of comprehensibility.
                  Since you’ll have familiarity with the characters and the
                  world of the story, you’ll possess an immense amount of
                  context which will help you interpret the plot and dialogue.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, when it comes to genres, realistic fiction tends to be
                  significantly more comprehensible than fantasy or sci fi, due
                  to the narrower range of vocabulary used.
                </p>
                <h3>The Nitty-Gritty of Listening</h3>
                <p>
                  When it comes to listening, admittedly not much changes
                  between Stage 1 and Stage 2. All of the recommendations
                  related to how to immerse and what to immerse with still hold.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Same as with Stage 1, when it comes to active listening
                  <b
                    >we still recommend against consuming the same piece of
                    content multiple times</b
                  >. The reason for this is the same as explained in the section
                  on reading.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Instead, we recommend continually using new content for active
                  listening; and then getting repetition by passively listening
                  to the content that you’ve already actively consumed once.
                  With that said, it’s fine to actively immerse with content
                  that you consumed multiple months or years ago. We are
                  specifically recommending to not actively consume the same
                  content multiple times <i>within a short timespan</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Although using content that you have actively listened to once
                  as passive immersion material is extremely beneficial, it’s
                  fine to passively immerse with new content as well. In
                  particular, as you continue to improve, content such as
                  podcasts and audiobooks start to become perfect passive
                  immersion content.
                </p>
                <h3>An Assortment of Tips</h3>
                <p>
                  Many people find that once they start to reach around Stage 2,
                  they understand enough of their target language for background
                  listening to become extremely distracting. Remember that
                  background listening refers to keeping a form of your target
                  language on in the background and mostly ignoring it, while
                  focusing on other mentally intensive tasks. If you begin to
                  experience this problem,
                  <b>you may try using inherently less distracting content</b>,
                  such as audiobooks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Otherwise, it’s also perfectly fine to drop background
                  immersion altogether if it’s distracting for you. However, we
                  do encourage you to continue taking advantage of passive
                  immersion, as it can drastically increase the amount of time
                  you spend with your target language. It is still a high enough
                  quality of immersion to, when combined with active immersion,
                  significantly contribute to your speed of progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On another note, once a gap forms between your listening and
                  reading ability, listening largely becomes a matter of
                  catching up to your reading ability. In a way, this makes
                  active listening extremely straightforward, as you’re simply
                  trying to auditorily pick out as much of what you can already
                  read as possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also: when listening, at times when your overall comprehension
                  is low, try to focus on picking out as many words as possible.
                  When your comprehension is higher, try to focus on
                  understanding the main gist of as many sentences as you can.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b
                    >Don’t get frustrated when you fail to hear words or phrases
                    that you can easily read</b
                  >. This is simply par for the course. As you continue to
                  actively and passively listen, the amount that you’re able to
                  understand will continue to grow. It really all boils down to
                  the number of hours you spend trying to understand the spoken
                  language.

                  change that will take place in your learning process will be
                  the monolingual transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the duration of Stage 1 and the initial portion of Stage
                  2, when you wanted to learn a word in your target language,
                  you looked up the word in a bilingual dictionary (a type of
                  dictionary that translates words between two languages). In
                  this case, it was between your native language and your target
                  language.
                  <b
                    >In contrast, a monolingual dictionary defines the words of
                    a language with the words from that</b
                  >
                  language; for example, an English-to-English dictionary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The monolingual transition is the process of transitioning to
                  using monolingual dictionaries, which enables you to begin
                  learning your target language entirely in your target
                  language. Making the monolingual transition is also referred
                  to as <b>“going monolingual.”</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  This breaking away from relying on your native language as a
                  crutch to learn your target language comes with many powerful
                  benefits. And it represents a significant landmark on the path
                  to fluency.

                <h2 id="reasons-monolingual">Reasons to go Monolingual</h2>
                <p>
                  Broadly speaking, there are four main benefits to making the
                  monolingual transition.
                </p>
                <h3>Reason #1</h3>
                <p>
                  Firstly, you will be able to
                  <b
                    >avoid creating false associations between words in your
                    native language and words in your target language</b
                  >. This idea was briefly touched on earlier in this guide (in
                  the section on dropping native language subs).
                </p>
                <p>
                  Basically, it’s very rare for a word in one language to have
                  an exact, one-to-one correlate in another language. For
                  example, take the Japanese word “warui” (悪い、わるい). The
                  most common English translation of the word “warui” is “bad.”
                  But in reality, “warui” is used quite differently than “bad”
                  in ways that often aren’t interchangeable with each other.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, in English, if someone has a low level of ability
                  in a skill, we say that they’re “bad” at it; e.g., “I’m bad at
                  playing the piano.” Thus, if you equated “warui” with “bad,”
                  you might assume that the Japanese sentence
                  “料理をしたのが悪かった” means “I was bad at cooking.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  In reality, it means something along the lines of, “Me having
                  cooked was a mistake.” This is because “warui” is never used
                  to describe a low level of ability. Rather, when being used in
                  reference to an action, it usually expresses something being
                  “bad” in the sense of leading to a bad end result for the
                  parties involved.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this specific scenario, in order to stop misconstruing
                  sentences that contain “warui,” somewhere along the line you
                  need to <i>un</i>learn that it can mean “low level of
                  ability”; it’s a false assumption you made as a consequence of
                  equating it with the word “bad.” Now, as long as you continued
                  to immerse, sooner or later this misunderstanding would become
                  apparent to you and get cleared up. But, until that happens,
                  it will cause confusion and interruption to your learning
                  process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you had instead learned “warui” using a Japanese
                  monolingual dictionary, then the false connection would have
                  never been made in your head in the first place. You would
                  have bypassed the entire process of mislearning and
                  unlearning. It’s not hard to understand how this would raise
                  the overall efficiency of your learning process.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But because there are close to no true one-to-one correlates
                  between languages,
                  <b
                    >these sorts of false associations happen all the time on
                    more subtle levels as well</b
                  >. Even if you aren’t outright misunderstanding the meaning of
                  a target language word, due to associating it with a word from
                  another language, you may subtly misunderstand the nuances or
                  connotations it has in certain situations.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is why completely decoupling your knowledge of your
                  target language from other languages is so useful. It allows
                  you to begin building a web of understanding that exists and
                  grows within its own closed system, without being constrained
                  by outside influences. At any rate, we will return to this
                  idea later when we look at the third reason that going
                  monolingual is beneficial.
                </p>
                <h3>Reason #2</h3>
                <p>
                  The second benefit of using a monolingual dictionary is that
                  it
                  <b
                    >reduces the amount of time it takes to fully comprehend
                    words</b
                  >. Understanding a word deeply enough to use it in the same
                  way as native speakers usually requires more than simply
                  understanding the technical meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, consider the difference between the word “hard”
                  and the word “difficult.” In a technical sense, the sentences
                  “calculus is hard” and “calculus is difficult” mean exactly
                  the same thing. But, if you’re fluent in English, you know
                  each of these two sentences <i>feel </i>slightly different.
                  “Difficult” feels slightly more formal and proper, while
                  “hard” feels more casual and laid-back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  However, it is practically impossible to accurately explain
                  the exact differences to someone who has never heard these
                  words before. The only way to truly grasp the full nuance is
                  to hear each of them countless times within many different
                  contexts and phrases. In this way, even monolingual
                  definitions have their limits when it comes to fully acquiring
                  words; because
                  <b>many words are to some degree undefinable</b> (i.e.,
                  difficult to pin down with a brief description). At the end of
                  the day, <b>immersion </b>is always going to be necessary in
                  order to fully master a given word.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With that said, in general, monolingual definitions are able
                  to take you much closer to the true nuance of a word than a
                  bilingual definition can. The reason for this is that, while
                  bilingual definitions tend to simply provide a list of similar
                  words from another language,
                  <b
                    >monolingual definitions actually attempt to articulate the
                    essence of the word.</b
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, take the Japanese word “tanjun” (単純,
                  たんじゅん). The online English-Japanese dictionary
                  <a href="https://jisho.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                    >Jisho</a
                  >
                  defines the word “tanjun” as:
                </p>
                <blockquote class="bq">
                  <p>“simple; plain; uncomplicated; straightforward.”</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  In the Japanese monolingual dictionary Daijirin (大辞林),
                  “tanjun” is defined as:
                </p>
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    <blockquote class="bq">
                      <ol>

                <p>
                  We can see that the monolingual definitions give a much more
                  in-depth idea of the exact meaning and usage of the word
                  “tanjun.” Simply by reading the bilingual definition, most
                  people probably wouldn’t assume that “tanjun” could be used as
                  a way to insult someone for lacking critical thinking ability.
                  Yet, this comes across very clearly in the monolingual
                  definition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, in general, monolingual definitions bring you much closer
                  to a complete understanding of words than bilingual
                  definitions do. This means that there will be significantly
                  less gap for you to bridge in order to fully understand words;
                  which in turn makes your overall learning process that much
                  more efficient.
                </p>
                <h3>Reason #3</h3>
                <p>
                  The third benefit of using a monolingual dictionary is that it
                  helps to
                  <b
                    >accelerate the process of learning to think in your target
                    language.</b
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  Normally, when trying to infer or recall the meaning of a word
                  in your target language, you do so by conjuring up equivalents
                  from your native language. But, once you’re able to function
                  monolingually, you’ll be able to contemplate words entirely
                  within the domain of your target language.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Take for example the scenario of reviewing Anki cards before
                  having gone monolingual. You’ll likely test your memory of a
                  target word’s meaning by recalling equivalents from your
                  native language. In contrast, after going monolingual, you’ll
                  be able to test yourself by recalling an approximation of the
                  monolingual definition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If language is a puzzle, then the monolingual transition leads
                  to a huge increase of intimacy with the puzzle pieces. As
                  such, it marks a big step towards learning to think in your
                  target language.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On a side note, editors put a lot of thought into how
                  dictionary definitions should be written. Through this as
                  well, you will gain further insight into how native speakers
                  think.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As we touched on previously,
                  <b
                    >the potential to describe a language in terms of another is
                    limited</b
                  >. On the other hand, describing words within its own language
                  is limitless. It allows you to make direct references to other
                  words and concepts from that language. As a result, your
                  accuracy and precision with the meaning of words will
                  increase; for example, your ability to notice the subtle
                  differences between synonyms will increase massively.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One side benefit of learning to think in your target language
                  occurs whenever you are speaking with native speakers. That
                  is, whenever you don’t know or remember a word, you will be
                  able to describe the concept in terms of other words (and in a
                  way that the native speaker is very likely to understand). As
                  a language learner, this is extremely valuable.
                </p>
                <h3>Reason #4</h3>
                <p>
                  And the last, rather simple benefit of going monolingual, is
                  that it will
                  <b>increase the time you spend with your target language</b>.
                  As a language learner, you’re destined to frequently look up
                  words and phrases (and the occasional grammar structure).
                  Before going monolingual, all of this is done in your native
                  language. But once you go monolingual, all of that time will
                  be spent with target language definitions and explanations.
                  Even if it’s not much, this still means spending more time
                  overall with your target language. This additional time can
                  add up in the long term, thus increasing the speed at which
                  you improve.

                  The Challenges of Going Monolingual
                </h2>
                <p>
                  There are two hurdles that must be overcome to become able to
                  understand monolingual definitions.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The first of these is overcoming what we call
                  <b>“dictionary vocabulary.”</b> These are words that show up
                  rather infrequently within most types of content, yet appear
                  frequently inside monolingual definitions. Their essential
                  function is to allow definitions of abstract concepts to be
                  expressed precisely. As such, they tend to not lend themselves
                  very well to the purposes of everyday conversation.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, here is
                  <a
                    href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cut"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener"
                    >Merriam-Webster’s first definition for “cut”</a
                  >:
                </p>
                <blockquote class="bq">
                  <p>“to penetrate with or as if with an edged instrument.”</p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  Now, since you’re reading this guide, chances are you don’t
                  have any trouble understanding this definition. However, it’s
                  not hard to imagine that if someone was near Stage 2 of using
                  MIA to acquire English, they likely wouldn’t yet know the word
                  “penetrate,” or the fact that “instrument” can refer to tools.
                  These are words that an English learner may not learn through
                  general immersion until Stage 3 or 4. Although they show up
                  infrequently in contexts like TV or daily conversation, these
                  words come up quite frequently within the dictionary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you postponed going monolingual until you had learned all
                  of this “dictionary vocabulary” from general immersion, you
                  would likely end up waiting until Stage 4 to make the
                  transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But, in truth,
                  <b
                    >the amount of “dictionary vocabulary” is actually quite
                    small</b
                  >. We estimate that, depending on the language and specific
                  dictionary, there are around 300 to 500 of them. In other
                  words, by learning these specific 300 to 500 words going
                  monolingual in Stage 2 becomes completely accessible. We will
                  talk about <b>how to go about learning</b> this “dictionary
                  vocabulary” in <b>the next section.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  The other hurdle that must be overcome in order to go
                  monolingual is getting used to the
                  <b
                    >abstract and self-referential writing style of
                    definitions</b
                  >. Furthermore, due to the abstract yet technical nature of
                  defining words, definitions frequently contain grammar that is
                  difficult to understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, clauses may be nested within clauses that are
                  also nested within other clauses; or one abstract concept will
                  be described by a combination of two other abstract concepts.
                  All of this can make monolingual definitions fairly difficult
                  to wrap your head around.
                </p>
                <p>
                  To give a concrete illustration, here is
                  <a
                    href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/experience"
                    target="_blank"

                    >Merriam-Webster’s second definition for “experience”</a
                  >:
                </p>
                <blockquote class="bq">
                  <p>

                <p>
                  Even if you’re a native English speaker, this might still be a
                  little hard to parse on the first go. The three uses of “or”
                  force you to hold a large number of qualifiers in your head
                  while processing it. This, combined with the inherently
                  abstract nature of what the definition is trying to describe,
                  results in something a bit difficult to digest.
                </p>
                <h3>Overcoming the Challenges</h3>
                <p>
                  Here are some simple techniques you can use to smoothly
                  overcome the challenges explained above and successfully make
                  the transition. In this section we’ll give an overview of some
                  techniques, and in a later section we’ll go into the
                  nitty-gritty details of how exactly to apply them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, let’s talk about learning the “dictionary vocabulary.”
                  Your first thought might be to acquire a list of all the
                  dictionary vocabulary used in your specific target language.
                  Now, if you’re able to find such a list, it may indeed be
                  useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But, there’s really no need to do that because
                  <b
                    >we can simply use the monolingual dictionary itself as a
                    list</b
                  >. All you have to do is start looking up words in the
                  monolingual dictionary, and if the definition contains any
                  words that you don’t know, then use the bilingual dictionary
                  to learn those words. In this way, we can use the bilingual
                  dictionary as a springboard to help us reach the point of
                  being able to function fully monolingually.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you reach Stage 2, it starts becoming important to
                  <b>choose wisely</b> which words you add to the SRS (we’ll
                  talk about this in the SRS section as well). Memorizing rare
                  words that won’t come up in your immersion is not only a waste
                  of time, but also the loss of an opportunity to learn
                  something actually useful. Despite that, in the context of
                  making the monolingual transition, we recommend assuming that
                  nearly every word you see used in a definition is worth
                  learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  By definition, “dictionary vocabulary” is comprised of words
                  that aren’t very useful outside the context of the dictionary.
                  However, because being able to function monolingually brings
                  so many benefits, anything that improves your ability to
                  understand definitions is valuable and worth learning. So, in
                  general, once you begin transitioning, start to prioritize
                  learning words that you come across inside of monolingual
                  definitions, <b>even if they seem uncommon.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  When it comes to learning to understand the dense grammar and
                  unique writing style of monolingual definitions, patience and
                  effort are required. At first, you’re not going to understand
                  very much. Even so, if you are ready to make the transition,
                  there will be definitions here and there that you’ll be able
                  to understand.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over time, as you read more and more definitions, your brain
                  will gradually figure out how to parse more and more
                  complicated definitions. Ultimately, like everything else in
                  language acquisition, things boil down to practice. It’s only
                  through <b>struggling </b>through it that you’ll come out on
                  the other end with meaningful ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                  That said, there is a simple technique that you can use to
                  expedite this process;
                  <b
                    >reading the monolingual definitions of words you already
                    know.</b
                  >
                  If you look up in the monolingual dictionary a target language
                  word that you already know, then you will know from beforehand
                  the general meaning that the definition will try to express
                  (we’ll talk more about this in Phase 1 of the monolingual
                  transition). This will make the definition much more
                  comprehensible, and can help illuminate how the grammar is
                  functioning.
                </p>
                <h3>When to Go Monolingual and How Long It Takes</h3>
                <p>
                  There is a lot of room for customization and personal
                  experimentation when it comes to making the monolingual
                  transition. The first thing to think about is when to start
                  the transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The longer you postpone going monolingual, the more ability
                  you will have at the time of transition, and the easier
                  transitioning will be. Conversely, the earlier you make the
                  transition, the more difficult it will be; but all the sooner
                  you’ll begin receiving the benefits. Some people are excited
                  by the idea of the going monolingual, feeling called to start
                  as early as Stage 1. Others are more wary of the work
                  required, and are tempted to perpetually put it off.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our recommendation is to
                  <b>attempt transitioning as soon as you feel motivated to</b>.
                  There’s really no harm in starting “too early.” If you find
                  yourself feeling unready and overwhelmed when you start
                  working with the monolingual dictionary, consider trying again
                  in a month or two. There’s nothing wrong with that. Because
                  the monolingual dictionary is comprised of raw text, you’re
                  likely to have a smoother transition once you’ve gained a
                  basic foundation in reading raw text (how to do that is
                  discussed in the Raw Text section).
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Although</b>, if you find yourself nearing the end of Stage
                  2 without having made the transition, we recommend making it a
                  priority. Being able to function monolingually is one of the
                  criteria for completing Stage 2.
                </p>
                <h3>How Quickly to Complete the Transition</h3>
                <p>
                  The next thing to think about is how quickly you intend to
                  complete the transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  One option is to <b>set aside your usual immersion</b> in
                  order to spend nearly all of your active study time working on
                  the transition. In this scenario, you might spend all of your
                  active immersion reading the monolingual dictionary, in
                  addition to learning only “dictionary vocabulary” inside of
                  Anki. If you took this approach, assuming that you already
                  have a foundation in reading raw text and at least a few hours
                  available daily to dedicate to transitioning, you may be able
                  to finish most of the transition within a few weeks.
                </p>
                <p>
                  On the other hand,
                  <b>it’s also possible to make the transition gradually</b>
                  over the course of six months (approx.), continuing general
                  immersion and studies alongside making the transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Either of these options is completely fine, as well as
                  everything in between. For example, you could make the first
                  half of the transition gradually, and then spend a week of
                  concentrated study to complete the transition. What you choose
                  largely boils down to personal preference.

                  The Phases of the Monolingual Transition
                </h2>
                <p>
                  Here we are, at the nitty gritty of the monolingual
                  transition. There are four phases to the monolingual
                  transition, which are largely distinguished by the
                  <i>exercises </i>you do. As you progress through the
                  transition, you will use the monolingual dictionary
                  increasingly often. With that out of the way, let’s get
                  started with Phase 1.
                </p>
                <h3>Phase 1</h3>
                <p>
                  In order to perform the following exercise, start by setting
                  aside some time specifically for working with the monolingual
                  dictionary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First,
                  <b
                    >take a target language word you already know and look it up
                    in the monolingual dictionary</b
                  >. Then, read the definition and see if you can understand it.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If there are no unknown words and you’re able to understand
                  it, then great! If there are no unknown words, but you’re not
                  quite able to understand it, that’s fine too. It’s bound to
                  happen and it should be expected.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you’re done working with a word in this way, simply
                  choose a new word to look up and repeat the process. That is,
                  <i>unless there are unknown words in the definition</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Now,
                  <b
                    >in the case that there are unknown words in the
                    definition</b
                  >, look to see if any of the sentences inside the definition
                  are <b>1T</b> (one-target; containing exactly one unknown
                  word). If a 1T sentence exists, look its
                  <b>unknown word</b> up in the
                  <b><i>bilingual </i>dictionary</b>. Then, check to see if
                  doing so allows you to understand the sentence.
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If it does, then make a text-based sentence card with: the
                    1T sentence from the definition on the front, and the
                    bilingual definition of its unknown word on the back.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If you still don’t understand the sentence after looking up
                    the unknown word, then either: do nothing, or add the word
                    to a list of words to learn later.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  If the definition contains only sentences that are MT
                  (multi-target; contains multiple unknown words), then either:
                  do nothing, or add those words to a list of words that you
                  want to learn later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Later, for each word on the list that you’ve been making, use
                  a search engine or example sentence website to find a 1T
                  sentence that contains that word, and make a text-based
                  sentence card with: that new 1T sentence on the front (that
                  you just searched for), and the bilingual definition of the
                  word on the back.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Outside of doing this specific exercise</b>, you’ll want to
                  return to using the bilingual dictionary to look words up
                  while immersing and making cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This Phase 1 exercise will help you simultaneously learn
                  dictionary vocabulary and adjust to the grammar of monolingual
                  definitions. If you’re making a more gradual transition, you
                  could spend your first month doing the exercise for five
                  minutes a day. If you’re making a more condensed transition,
                  you could make this exercise the core of the first week or so
                  of your transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you’ve made around 100 sentence cards with this exercise,
                  move on to the next phase.
                </p>
                <h3>Phase 2</h3>
                <p>
                  For this exercise, prepare by gathering 1T sentences while
                  doing your general immersion. <b>Don’t</b> make Anki cards for
                  these 1T sentences on the spot. Instead, add them to a list of
                  sentences that you want to make cards for later.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Set aside some time specifically for working with the
                  monolingual dictionary. Take one of the 1T sentences you found
                  while immersing and look up the <b>target word</b> (the
                  unknown word) in the monolingual dictionary. Read the
                  definition and see if you can understand the sentence:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If there are no unknown words and you’re able to understand
                    the sentence, then make a (monolingual) text-based sentence
                    card with: the 1T sentence on the front, and the monolingual
                    definition of the word on the back.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If there are unknown words in the monolingual definition,
                    then make (bilingual) sentence cards to learn the unknown
                    words. In the case that the monolingual definition doesn’t
                    contain an adequate 1T sentence for an unknown word, find
                    replacement 1T sentences for the unknown words using a
                    search engine or example sentence website.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In both of the above scenarios, make sure to also make
                    mental notes of what each of the unknown words mean.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  After making the bilingual cards for the unknown words and
                  taking mental notes of what they mean, see if the original
                  monolingual definitions become comprehensible. Then:
                </p>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    If the monolingual definition still doesn’t make sense, then
                    simply don’t make a monolingual sentence card for the word.
                    If you still want to learn the word, you can make a
                    bilingual sentence card out of it.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    If the monolingual definition now makes sense, then make a
                    monolingual sentence card with: the original 1T sentence for
                    the word on the front, and the monolingual definition of the
                    word on the back. In some cases, you may also want to add
                    the bilingual definitions to the back of the card.
                  </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  Now, don’t study the above monolingual sentence card
                  immediately. <b>Suspend it in Anki</b>. Wait until a couple
                  days have passed after having learned the bilingual cards for
                  the unknown words. Then <b>un-suspend</b> it and continue
                  learning it normally from there.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Outside of doing this specific exercise, continue using the
                  bilingual dictionary to look words up while immersing and
                  making cards.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This exercise gets you actually learning new words through
                  monolingual definitions, while helping you to continue
                  learning dictionary vocabulary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you’re able to understand
                  <b>around 75% of monolingual definitions</b> without looking
                  anything up, move on to the next stage. By “understand,” we
                  mean understanding <i>enough </i>of the definition to get a
                  <b>solid grasp</b> on what the word being defined means. As
                  long as this is the case, it’s fine if there are portions of
                  the definition that you don’t understand.
                </p>
                <h3>Phase 3</h3>
                <p>
                  Continue the processes laid out in Phase 2, except
                  <i>now </i>when you come across an unknown word inside of a
                  monolingual definition you’ll be doing something different.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <b>Instead </b>of looking up the unknown word in the bilingual
                  dictionary, look that unknown word up in the
                  <b>monolingual dictionary</b>. This is what’s known as a “<b
                    >recursive look-up</b
                  >.” Multi-layered recursive look-ups can get messy and
                  frustrating very quickly; so, if you’re still at a loss for
                  understanding a word after going two layers deep, simply
                  revert to the bilingual dictionary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In this phase, instead of setting aside time specifically for
                  practicing with the monolingual dictionary, simply start
                  making <i>all </i>of your cards this way. This means that most
                  of the cards you make shouldn’t contain any English<b>.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Outside of making cards, you can continue to use the bilingual
                  dictionary for quickly looking things up while immersing.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Move onto Phase 4 once you feel comfortable<b> </b>enough with
                  the monolingual dictionary to begin using it for on-the-fly
                  look-ups as well, in addition to card creation.
                </p>
                <h3>Phase 4</h3>
                <p>
                  Continue the process laid out in Phase 3, except start
                  transitioning to using the monolingual dictionary
                  <i>outside of making cards as well</i>. Start moving toward
                  reaching the point where, even when doing quick look-ups while
                  immersing, you virtually always use a monolingual dictionary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  When you first start this phase, it’s fine to use the
                  monolingual dictionary for quick look-ups when you have
                  energy; but, reverting back to the bilingual dictionary when
                  tired. Similarly, if you look something up in the monolingual
                  dictionary and it doesn’t immediately click, it’s fine to
                  instantly revert back to the bilingual dictionary rather than
                  grappling with the monolingual definition and doing recursive
                  look-ups (this applies to
                  <i>look-ups while immersing only</i>). Over time,
                  <b
                    >as your comfort with the monolingual dictionary continues
                    to increase, gradually reduce how often you revert to the
                    bilingual dictionary.</b
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  Once you rely solely on the monolingual dictionary for over
                  95% of all your look-ups, when making cards as well as looking
                  things up on the fly, you’ll be functioning fully
                  monolingually. Now, your monolingual transition is considered
                  complete.
                </p>
                <h2>Weaknesses of the Monolingual Dictionary</h2>
                <p>
                  Certain categories of words have
                  <b>disproportionately </b>complex and convoluted monolingual
                  definitions. While in the process of making the transition,
                  it’s a good idea to simply revert to the bilingual dictionary
                  for these kinds of words. For some specific categories of
                  words, you will want to continue relying on the bilingual
                  dictionary even after fully completing the monolingual
                  transition.
                </p>
                <p>
                  First, we have words with excessively simple meanings. It may
                  seem counterintuitive at first, but when a word refers to
                  something extremely simple, sometimes it actually becomes
                  quite complicated to define.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, take
                  <a
                    href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/thing"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener"
                    >the following Merriam-Webster definition:</a
                  >
                </p>
                <blockquote class="bq">
                  <p>
                    “an object or entity not precisely designated or capable of
                    being designated.”
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>This is the first definition listed for the word “thing.”</p>
                <p>Another example is:</p>
                <blockquote class="bq">
                  <p>
                    “used as a function word to indicate that a following noun
                    or noun equivalent is definite or has been previously
                    specified by context or by circumstance.”
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  That’s
                  <a
                    href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/the"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener"
                    >Merriam-Webster’s first definition of “the.”</a
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  To make things worse, these sorts of words often have a
                  multitude of slightly different meanings. Specifically,
                  Merriam-Webster lists over 20 different meanings of “the.”
                  These technical explanations of simple words can be
                  interesting to read once you’ve mastered the monolingual
                  dictionary, but they aren’t good training material. Before you
                  finish the transition, it’s best to simply consult the
                  bilingual dictionary for these kind of words.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next, we have nouns. Many nouns simply don’t lend themselves
                  to being described with words very well. For example, the
                  <a
                    href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/piano"
                    target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener"
                    >Merriam-Webster definition of “piano”</a
                  >
                  is:
                </p>
                <blockquote class="bq">
                  <p>
                    “a musical instrument having steel wire strings that sound
                    when struck by felt-covered hammers operated from a
                    keyboard.”
                  </p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>
                  If you had never seen a piano before, that description is
                  unlikely to give you a good sense of what a piano actually
                  looks like and how it works.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Another similar issue is that, in order to be accurate,
                  sometimes a monolingual dictionary will describe everyday
                  items in <b>technical terms</b>; which has the potential to be
                  confusing even to native speakers. For example, the
                  <a
                    href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/camera"
                    target="_blank"

                <blockquote class="bq">
                  <p>
                    “a device that consists of a lightproof chamber with an

                    (as on a photosensitive film or an electronic sensor) or for
                    translation into electrical impulses (as for television
                    broadcast).”

                <p>
                  If you look up a noun in the monolingual dictionary and figure
                  that the definition is going to be either too technical or
                  abstract to be helpful, it’s probably best to just let it go.

                  <i>But</i>, before reverting to the bilingual dictionary,
                  consider searching the word in Google Images. When it comes to
                  nouns,
                  <b>often times a picture really is worth a thousand words</b>.
                  If you find a picture that clears up the meaning of a word,
                  feel free to put it on the back of an Anki card instead of a
                  monolingual definition. We consider images to be
                  <i>completely fair game</i> as far as functioning
                  monolingually goes. If the word in question is a place name,
                  color, species of plant or animal, or really any kind of
                  physical object, Google Images is likely to be more helpful
                  than the monolingual dictionary.
                </p>
                <p>
                  It’s also important to note that the monolingual definitions
                  of everyday nouns often contain words which fall
                  <b>outside </b>of what we would call “dictionary vocabulary.”
                </p>
                <p>
                  We defined “dictionary vocabulary” as words that are generally
                  uncommon, but show up frequently within monolingual
                  definitions. Within the monolingual definitions of these
                  everyday nouns, oftentimes words are used that are
                  <i>uncommon both inside and outside of the dictionary</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, take the definition of “camera” from before. It
                  uses words such as “aperture” and “photosensitive,” which are
                  <b>highly domain specific</b> and unlikely to show up in daily
                  life and within other definitions. So, be sure to watch out
                  for this, as you probably want to
                  <b
                    >avoid spending time learning domain specific words
                    initially.</b
                  >
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, there is one last subcategory of nouns that (even
                  after mastering the monolingual dictionary) you will probably
                  want to use the bilingual dictionary to learn:
                  <b>technical academic terminology.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  These include words like the names of historic events, the
                  names of planets, and scientific terms such as “atom” or
                  “neuron.” Because these words have standardized technical
                  meanings within their respective domains,
                  <b>they have exact one-to-one correlates in every language</b
                  >. The word “hydrogen” means the exact same thing as the
                  Japanese and French equivalents for “hydrogen.” One way to
                  think about it is that each of these words point to a specific
                  concept, and the concept itself is
                  <b>language independent</b>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, if you already know what “hydrogen” means in English, then
                  there’s no need to learn your target language’s word for
                  “hydrogen” through the monolingual dictionary. Simply
                  associating the English word “hydrogen” with your target
                  language’s equivalent is enough. In fact, even though the
                  opposite is true for most words, making clear associations in
                  your head between native language and target language
                  technical terms is useful, as it will help you easily transfer
                  technical knowledge you gain in one language into the other.
                </p>
                <h2>Wrapping up the Monolingual Transition</h2>
                <h3>Language Distance and Going Monolingual</h3>
                <p>
                  If your target language is closely related to your native
                  language, going monolingual won’t be quite as important, and
                  likely won’t be as beneficial.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Like we mentioned in the previous section, all languages share
                  technical academic terms. When talking about completely
                  unrelated languages like English and Japanese, those are just
                  about the only true one-to-one correlates you’re going to find
                  between the two languages. With these languages, a monolingual
                  definition is usually going to trump a bilingual one in terms
                  of accuracy.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But, if two languages are genealogically related, that means
                  that at
                  <b
                    >one point in history they were literally the same
                    language</b
                  >. Because of this, related languages often still share many
                  <b>one-to-one cognates</b> outside of technical terminology as
                  well. When learning these words, the bilingual dictionary is
                  most useful.
                </p>
                <p>
                  So, if you’re learning a language that’s closely related to
                  your native language, we recommend putting<b>
                    less overall emphasis</b
                  >
                  on the monolingual transition. This can take the form of
                  waiting longer to begin the transition, and continuing to
                  reference bilingual dictionaries alongside monolingual ones
                  even after making the transition.
                </p>
                <h3>Misc. Tips about Dictionaries &amp; Going Monolingual</h3>
                <p>
                  Paper dictionaries can be fun to flip through, but for our
                  purposes it’s crucial that you have access to electronic
                  dictionaries. Being able to instantly look up words and
                  copy/paste their definitions onto cards is a game changer in
                  the world of language learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you can, try to find as many different monolingual
                  dictionaries as you can for your target language.
                  <b>Every dictionary will have its own flavor</b>, pros, and
                  cons. Some are more technical, some use more everyday
                  language. Some are more comprehensive, some more bare bones.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Because every dictionary is different, the more dictionaries
                  you have at your disposal, the higher the chance that you’ll
                  be able to understand at least one of their definitions for a
                  given word. Additionally, comparing and contrasting
                  definitions from different dictionaries can help reveal the
                  true meaning of the word in question. It’s also fine to put
                  multiple definitions of the same word on a single Anki card if
                  you think it will help you grasp the meaning.
                </p>
                <p>
                  We also recommend finding at least one
                  <b>monolingual dictionary app</b> for your phone. This way,
                  you will be able to look things up monolingually wherever you
                  are. This will become particularly useful once you reach Phase
                  4 of the Monolingual Transition, where you will begin using
                  the monolingual dictionary for on-the-fly look-ups as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Lastly, if a monolingual definition really isn’t clicking,
                  another option you can try before resorting to the bilingual
                  dictionary is <b>googling the word or phrase in question</b>,
                  along with the word for “meaning” in your target language. If
                  you’re lucky, you’ll be able to find a forum or blog post
                  where someone has given the meaning of the word or phrase in
                  simple language. Feel free to copy and paste these sorts of
                  casual descriptions onto your cards as well.
                </p>
                <h3>Monolingual Transition Q&amp;A</h3>
                <h4>
                  Even when I understand monolingual definitions, things are
                  blurry. Wouldn’t I understand more with the bilingual
                  dictionary?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Everyone feels like this at first. Just like with learning to
                  read raw text, things start out blurry and gradually get
                  clearer over time. This is simply the nature of the learning
                  process. It may be true that, initially, using the monolingual
                  dictionary will cause a drop in your level of understanding.
                  But,
                  <b
                    >persevering through the initial period will be well worth
                    it in the long term</b
                  >. Once you master the monolingual dictionary, you’ll be able
                  to understand words incomparably greater than you were ever
                  able to with the bilingual dictionary.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  I understood part of a monolingual definition, but not the
                  whole thing. Can I still use this definition to learn the
                  target word?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Yes. Even if you didn’t understand an entire monolingual
                  definition, as long as you understood <i>enough </i>to get
                  what the word you looked up means, then that is enough.
                </p>
                <p>
                  With that said, if the definition in question contained any
                  unknown words, it may be a good idea to add them to a list to
                  learn later. Remember, in general, words that show up within
                  monolingual definitions are worth learning.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  Sometimes I think I understood a monolingual definition, but
                  I’m not completely sure. Is it okay to double check with the
                  bilingual dictionary?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Yes, it’s perfectly fine to double check with the bilingual
                  dictionary. However, don’t put the bilingual definition on
                  your Anki card. Just confirm that your interpretation of the
                  monolingual definition was correct, and then go with that.
                  Some people worry that looking at a bilingual definition even
                  once will “spoil” their understanding of the word. But, this
                  isn’t something you need to worry about. If you can understand
                  the monolingual definition, looking at an English translation
                  won’t cause any harm.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  If a word has multiple different meanings, should I put the
                  entire definition on the back of my card, or only the portion
                  necessary for understanding the target sentence?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  It’s fine either way, but our recommendation is to put the
                  entire definition, and perhaps bolding the portion relevant to
                  the target sentence. This way, when reviewing the card, even
                  if you only read the portion that’s bolded, you’ll still see
                  the rest of the definition out of the corner of your eye; this
                  will help you remember that the word has multiple meanings.
                  Due to that, when you come across the word in the wild,
                  <b
                    >you will be quicker to recognize when the word is being
                    used with a meaning other than the one you memorized.</b
                  >
                </p>
                <h4>
                  Can I make sentence cards out of the contents of monolingual
                  definitions?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Totally. Any piece of language that was created by a native
                  speaker for other native speakers is game when it comes to
                  sentence mining, including monolingual definitions. If you
                  want to learn a word that you found in a monolingual
                  definition, but the definition lacks context or is too
                  abstract, it’s also fine to search for a replacement sentence
                  for that word.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  After going monolingual, should I go back and remove the
                  bilingual definitions from all my old Anki cards?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  Definitely not. That would take far more time and effort than
                  it would be worth. As you continue to review in Anki, you will
                  see your old Anki cards progressively less and less often
                  anyway.
                </p>
                <h4>
                  When reviewing monolingual sentence cards, should I memorize
                  monolingual definitions verbatim?
                </h4>
                <p>
                  That would be far too difficult; don’t do that. Just like with
                  bilingual sentence cards, simply try to remember the basic
                  gist of the word’s definition.
                </p>

                <p>
                  Besides shifting away from bilingual sentence cards with the
                  monolingual transition, not much changes between Stage 1 and
                  Stage 2 on the front of sentence mining and the SRS.
                </p>
                <p>
                  At this point, you may find it useful to go back and reread
                  the <b>“Sentence Cards”</b> and
                  <b>“Sentence Mining” </b>portions of the Stage 1 guide

                </p>
                <p>
                  If you maintain the recommended immersion to SRS time
                  allocation ratio (covered in the
                  <b>“Sentence Mining Q&amp;A” </b>section of the
                  <b>Japanese Quickstart Guide</b>), you should be ready to move
                  on from Stage 2 to Stage 3 after making another
                  <b>~3,000 sentence cards</b>. Combined with the ~3,000 you

                  One element of how you mine sentences that you may want to
                  change moving into Stage 2 is how you choose what sentences
                  are worth mining.
                </p>
                <h3>Choosing What Sentences Are Worth Mining</h3>
                <p>
                  In Stage 1, we recommended choosing what sentences to mine
                  based primarily on what grabs your attention. If a word seems
                  to stand out or feel familiar, that’s likely a sign that you
                  have already come across that word many times before. And, if
                  the same word is showing up multiple times in your immersion,
                  that means that it’s at least relatively common and definitely
                  worth your time to learn.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But,
                  <b
                    >by the time you reach Stage 2, you will have already
                    learned most extremely common words in the language</b
                  >. Once this happens, it might become rare that you come
                  across unknown words that feel familiar or pull your attention
                  in the same way that words did in Stage 1. Once this happens,
                  it can become hard to judge how valuable a word will be before
                  learning it. Once you reach this point,
                  <b>frequency lists</b> can become a useful tool.

                <h3>
                  Making Use of Frequency Lists to Determine the Words You Learn
                </h3>
                <p>
                  The traditional way to use a frequency list is to start at the
                  top of the list, and learn every word listed in order. As
                  mentioned in Stage 1, learning the most common 1,000 words in
                  this way can be an effective way to jump-start learning a new
                  language.
                </p>
                <p>
                  But, after that, choosing what words to learn based solely on
                  a frequency list isn’t an efficient strategy. The reason for
                  this is that <b>after the first~1,000 words on the list</b>,
                  the frequency of specific words starts
                  <b>differing greatly</b> depending on the specific sources the
                  list was created from. So, even if a frequency list you found
                  online says a word is common, in reality it might not come up
                  often in your own personal immersion.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In Stage 2 and above, we recommend using frequency lists to
                  help you roughly judge the value of words you come across in
                  your immersion. For example, if you searched the target word
                  of a 1T sentence up in a frequency list and it was positioned
                  around 4,000 on the list, then you could assume it’s worth
                  learning. Conversely, if it was positioned around 40,000 on
                  the list, you could assume it’s extremely uncommon and not
                  worth your time to learn. So, you’re not going to a frequency
                  list to find new words to learn, but simply using it to gauge
                  the usefulness of <b>words</b>
                  <b>that showed up in your immersion.</b>
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the duration of Stage 2, we recommend focusing on learning
                  words positioned below 15,000 on a frequency list.
                  <b
                    >As you continue to rise up the stages, you will continue to
                    expand the frequency range of words that you learn</b
                  >. Of course, the exception to this principle is dictionary
                  vocabulary, which, for reasons explained in the Monolingual
                  Transition section, you should generally value regardless of
                  frequency list position.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Always keep in mind that the frequency list you use likely
                  won’t be completely representative of your own personal
                  immersion. If a frequency list says a word is uncommon but
                  your intuition tells you to learn it, feel free to go ahead
                  and learn it anyway.
                </p>
                <p>
                  If you’re not able to find a frequency list for your target
                  language, or you simply prefer to not constantly reference a
                  frequency list, it’s also fine to continue relying solely on
                  your intuition when picking what words to learn from your
                  immersion. Any words that are truly important will be learned
                  sooner or later, and learning an uncommon word here and there
                  won’t do any harm.
