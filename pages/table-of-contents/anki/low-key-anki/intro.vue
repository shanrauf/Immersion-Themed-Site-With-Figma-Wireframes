    <h2>Low-Key Anki: Intro</h2>
    <p>
      When used with default settings, Anki's algorithm is horribly inefficient.
      Although we can never expect Anki's algorithm to approach the same levels
      of efficiency as more advanced algorithms such as SuperMemo's, by
      modifying Anki's settings in the right way, we can make significant
      strides in that direction. Making Anki's algorithm more efficient means
      becoming able to learn <em>more things in less time</em>, and in certain
      situations, <em>remembering what we learn better</em>. Sounds nice,
      doesn't it?
    </p>

    <p>
      The following is an in-depth guide that aims to provide a deep
      understanding of a specific aspect of Anki optimization: what I call the
      <em>ease factor problem</em>, and its solution, the
      <em>Low-Key Anki</em> setup. The Low-Key Anki setup is a series of
      counterintuitive simplifications one can make to Anki's algorithm that
      result in a significant boost in efficiency, as well as a considerable
      reduction in the stress associated with reviewing cards. The first two
      sections cover broader aspects of the mechanisms behind spaced repetition,
      which will provide a foundation for understanding not only the
      <em>ease factor problem</em> and <em>Low-Key Anki</em> but other aspects
      of Anki optimization that I will be covering in the future as well, such
      as optimal retention rate. I recommend watching

      how Anki's algorithm works.

      If you are not interested in investing the time and effort to fully
      understand Anki's algorithm, its problems, and the solutions to those
      problems, and wish to blindly implement my advice because you trust that I
      know what I'm talking about, then you can skip to the

      section for a TL;DR explanation of the Low-Key Anki setup and instructions
      for how to implement it.

      That said, I highly encourage you to
      <em>empower yourself</em> by learning how this program you plan on
      investing so many hours into actually works. To quote

      "A shepherd builds a counting system that works by throwing a pebble into
      a bucket whenever a sheep leaves the fold, and taking a pebble out
      whenever a sheep returns. If you, the apprentice, do not understand this
      system - if it is magic that works for no apparent reason - then you will
      not know what to do if you accidentally drop an extra pebble into the
      bucket. That which you cannot make yourself, you cannot remake when the
      situation calls for it. You cannot go back to the source, tweak one of the
      parameter settings, and regenerate the output, without the source."
