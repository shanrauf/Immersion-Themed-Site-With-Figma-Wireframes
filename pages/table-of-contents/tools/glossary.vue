      <h2>Accent</h2>
      The manner in which one pronounces a language. Can be broken down into
      <em>pronunciation of vowels and consonants</em>,
      <em>stress accent/ pitch accent/ tones</em> (depending on the language in
      question), and <em>intonation</em>. As an L2 speaker, accent is arguably
      the most difficult aspect of language to fully master. The term “native
      accent” is vague, as native speakers of a language will pronounce the
      language differently depending on their generation, social class, specific
      area, and personality. That said, talking to an unsuspecting native
      speaker on the phone and seeing if they notice that you are an L2 speaker
      or not is a practical way to test how native-like your accent is. It is
      extremely rare for adult learners to achieve the level of accent
      authenticity required to pass this test, but people such as
      <a to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashan" rel="noopener">Dashan</a>
      and
      <a to="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYlnJpvRwX8" rel="noopener"
        >Julien Gaudfroy</a
      >
      have proved that it is indeed possible. Developing a native-like accent
      hinges on the ability to accurately perceive and notice the subtleties of
      spoken language. Many factors go into the development of accent, but
      <em>waiting to output</em> and
      <em>prioritizing listening over reading</em> in the early stages seem to
      consistently lead to developing a more native-like accent. Age and
      motivation also seem to play a large role. Consciously studying the
      phonetic system of the target language may allow one to become able to
      perceive and notice greater levels of subtlety when getting input, leading
      to acquiring a more native-like accent. Techniques such as
      <em>adopting a parent</em> and <em>shadowing</em> can also help one obtain
      a more native-like accent, but require a basic level of proficiency in the
      language to be effective.

      <h2>
        <a id="acquisition"></a>Acquisition (as opposed to <em>Learning</em>)
      </h2>
      The distinction between <em>acquisition</em> and <em>learning</em> was
      proposed by Stephen Krashen in his
      <em>acquisition–learning hypothesis</em>, one of the five hypotheses that
      constitute the <em>input hypothesis</em>. The
      <em>acquisition–learning hypothesis</em> claims that people can develop
      linguistic skills in two distinctly different ways: <em>acquisition</em>,
      and <em>learning</em>.

      <em>Acquisition</em> is the natural, automatic and effortless process
      through which children become proficient in their native language. Krashen
      claimed that this ability to pick-up language naturally is not lost after
      childhood, and given the right conditions (sufficient quality and quantity
      of linguistic input), adults will acquire language as well. Acquisition
      occurs subconsciously through comprehending linguistic input that contains
      new vocabulary or grammatical structures. Because the process is
      subconscious, one is not aware when it is happening, and is unlikely to
      recognize that anything has changed immediately after the fact.
      Acquisition is most likely to occur when one is meaningfully engaged in
      the message (rather than the form) of linguistic input, e.g., when
      engrossed in a TV show or deep in a thought-provoking conversation. While
      “you” are busy following the plot or formulating arguments, a deeper part
      of the mind is working hard to decode the nuances of language.
      Subjectively, acquisition manifests itself in the form of linguistic
      intuitions you can’t logically explain, or realizing that you know the
      meaning of words you never learned. For example, if you are a native
      speaker of English, you likely find “the big red dog” much more natural
      than “the red big dog.” There is a
      <a
        to="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/ja/grammar/british-grammar/about-adjectives-and-adverbs/adjectives-order"
        rel="noopener"
        >complicated grammatical rule</a
      >
      dictating why this is the case, but unless you have formally studied
      English grammar, you most likely have no idea what it is. Notice how you
      didn’t have to "think" about anything to know which of the two phrases is
      most natural; you <em>just knew</em>. In this way, accessing what one has
      acquired is, in most cases, instantaneous, effortless and direct.

      <h2>Active Immersion</h2>
      <em>Active Immersion</em> is one of the three main categories of
      Immersion, along with <em>Passive Immersion</em> and
      <em>Background Immersion</em>. Any time that one’s
      <strong>full and undivided attention</strong> is being directed towards an
      activity that is directly mediated by the target language, one is getting
      Active Immersion. Some examples include sitting down and reading a book,
      watching a movie or TV show without multitasking, or having a conversation
      with a native speaker. Whether one is simply getting lost in the
      <em>content</em> of input (e.g., enjoying the plot of a novel like a
      native speaker would) or heavily focusing on the <em>form</em> of input
      (e.g., analyzing intonation patterns while listening to an audiobook), as
      long as one is fully engaged in a linguistically-mediated activity, one is
      actively immersing. Fundamentally, all true linguistic ability is
      cultivated through immersion; knowledge gained through
      <a to="#active_study"><em>Active Study</em></a> can improve the efficiency
      at which language is acquired through immersion, but can’t directly cause
      acquisition on its own. Passive and Background Immersion can be extremely
      beneficial, but tend to only bring results to the extent that one is
      regularly getting significant doses of Active Immersion. This is why
      Active Immersion is the linchpin of MIA and language acquisition as a
      whole. Without Active Immersion, one will get nowhere; if one did
      <em>only</em> Active Immersion and nothing else, they would eventually
      achieve fluency in the language.

      <hr />

      <h2><a id="active_study"></a>Active Study</h2>
      <em>Active Study</em> refers to conscious, directed effort made to
      increase one’s knowledge of the target language. Active Study corresponds
      to <em>learning</em> in the <em>learning</em>/<a to="#acquisition"
        ><em>acquisition</em></a
      >
      dichotomy, and in the context of MIA, is usually contrasted with
      <em>Immersion</em>. Examples of Active Study include reading a grammar
      guide, watching a pronunciation tutorial on YouTube, or looking words up
      in a dictionary and creating Sentence Cards. In MIA, Active Study mostly
      revolves around making and reviewing SRS cards, although this is not
      always the case. Mastering a language without Active Study is possible,
      and there are examples of people successfully acquiring foreign languages
      through Immersion alone. That said, MIA's stance is that Active Study,
      <strong>when properly combined with Immersion</strong>, greatly
      accelerates the acquisition process. It is also worth noting that the
      value of Active Study decreases as one becomes more advanced in the
      language.

      <h2>AJATT</h2>
      AJATT, short for “All Japanese All the Time,” is a language learning blog
      created by Khatzumoto in 2006. The goal of AJATT was to document and
      improve upon the methods Khatzumoto used to become fluent in Japanese in
      the short span of 18 months. The method that he described (later known as
      “The AJATT Method”) was very similar to the <em>Antimoon</em> method, with
      the addition of James Heisig’s <em>Remembering the Kanji</em> and an
      emphasis on mindset and the psychology of success. Khatzumoto stressed the
      importance of being self-directed, creative, and willing to experiment. He
      argued that extraordinary results can’t be achieved with ordinary action,
      and encouraged people not to be held back by the desire for social
      acceptance. Above all, the bedrock of AJATT was the assertion that
      enjoying the process is an absolutely essential ingredient for success.
      Unfortunately, this greater message was lost on many, which resulted in
      AJATT becoming polarizing and controversial. Nevertheless, AJATT had a
      large impact on late 00’s Japanese learning community, popularizing the
      SRS and <em>Remembering the Kanji</em>, and spreading awareness of Stephen
      Krashen’s <em>Input Hypothesis</em>. Although AJATT began as a free blog,
      around 2010, Khatzumoto shifted his focus to creating questionable
      language learning products, which he sold with sleazy marketing techniques
      at unreasonably high prices. This aggressive marketing led many to
      mistakenly assume that all of AJATT, including the original free content,
      was nothing more than a scam, severely damaging AJATT’s reputation.
      Khatzumoto became increasingly less active, and eventually completely
      disappeared from the internet in 2014. He resurfaced in 2017 with the
      announcement that he had created a
      <a to="https://www.patreon.com/ajatt" rel="noopener">Patreon</a>, and will
      be writing articles on self-help and language learning for to those who
      subscribe. These new articles don’t seem to have attracted very much
      attention. MIA is heavily inspired by AJATT. Although there are areas in
      which they disagree, MIA and AJATT are much more alike than different.
      MIA’s stance is that AJATT’s biggest weakness is not its <em>ideas</em>,
      but the way it <em>communicates</em> those ideas. One could say that,
      fundamentally, MIA was founded with the goal of bringing Khatzumoto’s
      insights to a larger audience.

      <h2>Anki</h2>
      <a to="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" rel="noopener">Anki</a>
      is a free open-source SRS. It was created by Damien Elmes in 2006, and is
      regularly updated to this day. The spaced repetition algorithm Anki uses
      is a modified version of SM2, an algorithm created for SuperMemo in the
      late 1980s. Anki’s greatest strength is its flexibility and
      customizability. It runs on all major platforms (desktop and mobile,
      online and local), allows for easy importing and exporting, and has
      built-in syncing. Anki gives users the freedom to fully customize the
      design and organization of their cards, and even allows for modifications
      to the program itself in the form of add-ons. Add-ons and pre-made decks
      created by other users can be found on the Anki website. Anki’s other
      advantage is that, with the exception of Anki Mobile for iOS, it’s 100%
      free. Anki’s downside is that it requires a large amount of learning and
      modification to be used optimally. The extensive customizability can be
      overwhelming for new users, causing many to become frustrated and give up
      before fully adjusting to the program. Furthermore, Anki’s algorithm is
      simplistic and counterintuitive, and this leads many users to improperly
      grade cards and greatly hurt the effectiveness of the algorithm. This is
      exacerbated by the default algorithm settings being borderline nonsensical
      (Maximum reviews/day set to 200, New Interval set to 0%, etc.) Anki is
      MIA’s recommended SRS. The main reasons for this are the accessibility
      (it’s free and runs on all platforms), customizability (cards can be
      designed to fit the precise needs of the individual), and the many useful
      language-learning tools that have been created specifically for Anki, such
      as
      <a to="http://subs2srs.sourceforge.net/" rel="noopener">subs2srs</a>
      and
      <a to="https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan" rel="noopener">Yomichan</a>.
      MIA seeks to remedy Anki’s flaws by helping learners gain an in-depth
      understanding of the program such that they can use it optimally.

      <h2 id="MT">Multi-Target Sentence</h2>
      <strong>Also known as:</strong> MT sentence. A sentence that contains more
      than one unknown word or grammar structure. In other words, a sentence
      with multiple target words/structures.

      <h2 id="1T">One-Target Sentence</h2>
      <strong>Also known as:</strong> 1T sentence, single-target sentence. A
      sentence that contains one unknown word or grammar structure. The unknown
      word or structure is referred to as the "target word" or "target
      structure". A sentence is only considered to be 1T if, after looking up or
      inferring the meaning of the unknown word/structure, the overall meaning
      of the sentence becomes clear. If a sentence contains one unknown
      word/structure, but the overall meaning remains unclear even after looking
      up the target word/structure, the sentence is not considered to be 1T.
      Learning through 1T sentences can be thought of as "picking low-hanging
      fruit". It makes the target word/structure easy to understand and retain.
      As you continue to learn, sentences that were previously one-target will
      become zero-target, and sentences that were previously multi-target will
      become one-target. In this way, one-target sentences can take you all the
      way to fluency.

      <strong>Note</strong>: Previously, MIA referred to "1T sentences" as "i+1
      sentences". The term "i+1" comes from Stephen Krashen and his Input
      Hypothesis. From
      <a to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis" rel="noopener"
        >Wikipedia</a
      >: "[The Input Hypothesis] states that learners progress in their
      knowledge of the language when they comprehend language input that is
      slightly more advanced than their current level. Krashen called this level
      of input "i+1", where "i" is the learner's interlanguage and "+1" is the
      next stage of language acquisition." In other words, Krashen's "i+1"
      refers to input that is immediately comprehensible to the unconscious
      language acquisition device. On the other hand, MIA was using the term to
      refer to input that could be consciously comprehended after looking up or
      inferring the meaning of an unknown word or structure. In order to avoid
      confusion due to this slight difference in meaning, we decided to drop the
      term and adopt the more straightforward "one target" instead.

      <strong>Also known as:</strong> 0T Sentence. A sentence that doesn't

      sentence without a target word or target structure. If you know all the
      words/structures contained in a sentence but still can't understand the
      overall meaning, the sentence is still considered to be zero-target.
