    <h2>Accent</h2>
    The manner in which one pronounces a language. Can be broken down into
    <em>pronunciation of vowels and consonants</em>,
    <em>stress accent/ pitch accent/ tones</em> (depending on the language in
    question), and <em>intonation</em>. As an L2 speaker, accent is arguably the
    most difficult aspect of language to fully master. The term “native accent”
    is vague, as native speakers of a language will pronounce the language
    differently depending on their generation, social class, specific area, and
    personality. That said, talking to an unsuspecting native speaker on the
    phone and seeing if they notice that you are an L2 speaker or not is a
    practical way to test how native-like your accent is. It is extremely rare
    for adult learners to achieve the level of accent authenticity required to
    pass this test, but people such as
    <nuxt-link to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dashan" rel="noopener"
      >Dashan</nuxt-link
    >
    and
    <nuxt-link to="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYlnJpvRwX8" rel="noopener"
      >Julien Gaudfroy</nuxt-link
    >
    have proved that it is indeed possible. Developing a native-like accent
    hinges on the ability to accurately perceive and notice the subtleties of
    spoken language. Many factors go into the development of accent, but
    <em>waiting to output</em> and
    <em>prioritizing listening over reading</em> in the early stages seem to
    consistently lead to developing a more native-like accent. Age and
    motivation also seem to play a large role. Consciously studying the phonetic
    system of the target language may allow one to become able to perceive and
    notice greater levels of subtlety when getting input, leading to acquiring a
    more native-like accent. Techniques such as <em>adopting a parent</em> and
    <em>shadowing</em> can also help one obtain a more native-like accent, but
    require a basic level of proficiency in the language to be effective.

    <h2>
      <nuxt-link id="acquisition"></nuxt-link>Acquisition (as opposed to
      <em>Learning</em>)
    </h2>
    The distinction between <em>acquisition</em> and <em>learning</em> was
    proposed by Stephen Krashen in his <em>acquisition–learning hypothesis</em>,
    one of the five hypotheses that constitute the <em>input hypothesis</em>.
    The <em>acquisition–learning hypothesis</em> claims that people can develop
    linguistic skills in two distinctly different ways: <em>acquisition</em>,
    and <em>learning</em>.

    <em>Acquisition</em> is the natural, automatic and effortless process
    through which children become proficient in their native language. Krashen
    claimed that this ability to pick-up language naturally is not lost after
    childhood, and given the right conditions (sufficient quality and quantity
    of linguistic input), adults will acquire language as well. Acquisition
    occurs subconsciously through comprehending linguistic input that contains
    new vocabulary or grammatical structures. Because the process is
    subconscious, one is not aware when it is happening, and is unlikely to
    recognize that anything has changed immediately after the fact. Acquisition
    is most likely to occur when one is meaningfully engaged in the message
    (rather than the form) of linguistic input, e.g., when engrossed in a TV
    show or deep in a thought-provoking conversation. While “you” are busy
    following the plot or formulating arguments, a deeper part of the mind is
    working hard to decode the nuances of language. Subjectively, acquisition
    manifests itself in the form of linguistic intuitions you can’t logically
    explain, or realizing that you know the meaning of words you never learned.
    For example, if you are a native speaker of English, you likely find “the
    big red dog” much more natural than “the red big dog.” There is a
    <nuxt-link
      to="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/ja/grammar/british-grammar/about-adjectives-and-adverbs/adjectives-order"
      rel="noopener"
      >complicated grammatical rule</nuxt-link
    >
    dictating why this is the case, but unless you have formally studied English
    grammar, you most likely have no idea what it is. Notice how you didn’t have
    to "think" about anything to know which of the two phrases is most natural;
    you <em>just knew</em>. In this way, accessing what one has acquired is, in
    most cases, instantaneous, effortless and direct.

    <h2>Active Immersion</h2>
    <em>Active Immersion</em> is one of the three main categories of Immersion,
    along with <em>Passive Immersion</em> and <em>Background Immersion</em>. Any
    time that one’s <strong>full and undivided attention</strong> is being
    directed towards an activity that is directly mediated by the target
    language, one is getting Active Immersion. Some examples include sitting
    down and reading a book, watching a movie or TV show without multitasking,
    or having a conversation with a native speaker. Whether one is simply
    getting lost in the <em>content</em> of input (e.g., enjoying the plot of a
    novel like a native speaker would) or heavily focusing on the
    <em>form</em> of input (e.g., analyzing intonation patterns while listening
    to an audiobook), as long as one is fully engaged in a
    linguistically-mediated activity, one is actively immersing. Fundamentally,
    all true linguistic ability is cultivated through immersion; knowledge
    gained through
    <nuxt-link to="#active_study"><em>Active Study</em></nuxt-link> can improve
    the efficiency at which language is acquired through immersion, but can’t
    directly cause acquisition on its own. Passive and Background Immersion can
    be extremely beneficial, but tend to only bring results to the extent that
    one is regularly getting significant doses of Active Immersion. This is why
    Active Immersion is the linchpin of MIA and language acquisition as a whole.
    Without Active Immersion, one will get nowhere; if one did
    <em>only</em> Active Immersion and nothing else, they would eventually
    achieve fluency in the language.

    <h2><nuxt-link id="active_study"></nuxt-link>Active Study</h2>
    <em>Active Study</em> refers to conscious, directed effort made to increase
    one’s knowledge of the target language. Active Study corresponds to
    <em>learning</em> in the <em>learning</em>/<nuxt-link to="#acquisition"
      ><em>acquisition</em></nuxt-link
    >
    dichotomy, and in the context of MIA, is usually contrasted with
    <em>Immersion</em>. Examples of Active Study include reading a grammar
    guide, watching a pronunciation tutorial on YouTube, or looking words up in
    a dictionary and creating Sentence Cards. In MIA, Active Study mostly
    revolves around making and reviewing SRS cards, although this is not always
    the case. Mastering a language without Active Study is possible, and there
    are examples of people successfully acquiring foreign languages through
    Immersion alone. That said, MIA's stance is that Active Study,
    <strong>when properly combined with Immersion</strong>, greatly accelerates
    the acquisition process. It is also worth noting that the value of Active
    Study decreases as one becomes more advanced in the language.

    <h2>AJATT</h2>
    AJATT, short for “All Japanese All the Time,” is a language learning blog
    created by Khatzumoto in 2006. The goal of AJATT was to document and improve
    upon the methods Khatzumoto used to become fluent in Japanese in the short
    span of 18 months. The method that he described (later known as “The AJATT
    Method”) was very similar to the <em>Antimoon</em> method, with the addition
    of James Heisig’s <em>Remembering the Kanji</em> and an emphasis on mindset
    and the psychology of success. Khatzumoto stressed the importance of being
    self-directed, creative, and willing to experiment. He argued that
    extraordinary results can’t be achieved with ordinary action, and encouraged
    people not to be held back by the desire for social acceptance. Above all,
    the bedrock of AJATT was the assertion that enjoying the process is an
    absolutely essential ingredient for success. Unfortunately, this greater
    message was lost on many, which resulted in AJATT becoming polarizing and
    controversial. Nevertheless, AJATT had a large impact on late 00’s Japanese
    learning community, popularizing the SRS and <em>Remembering the Kanji</em>,
    and spreading awareness of Stephen Krashen’s <em>Input Hypothesis</em>.
    Although AJATT began as a free blog, around 2010, Khatzumoto shifted his
    focus to creating questionable language learning products, which he sold
    with sleazy marketing techniques at unreasonably high prices. This
    aggressive marketing led many to mistakenly assume that all of AJATT,
    including the original free content, was nothing more than a scam, severely
    damaging AJATT’s reputation. Khatzumoto became increasingly less active, and
    eventually completely disappeared from the internet in 2014. He resurfaced
    in 2017 with the announcement that he had created a
    <nuxt-link to="https://www.patreon.com/ajatt" rel="noopener"
      >Patreon</nuxt-link
    >, and will be writing articles on self-help and language learning for to
    those who subscribe. These new articles don’t seem to have attracted very
    much attention. MIA is heavily inspired by AJATT. Although there are areas
    in which they disagree, MIA and AJATT are much more alike than different.
    MIA’s stance is that AJATT’s biggest weakness is not its <em>ideas</em>, but
    the way it <em>communicates</em> those ideas. One could say that,
    fundamentally, MIA was founded with the goal of bringing Khatzumoto’s
    insights to a larger audience.

    <h2>Anki</h2>
    <nuxt-link to="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" rel="noopener">Anki</nuxt-link> is
    a free open-source SRS. It was created by Damien Elmes in 2006, and is
    regularly updated to this day. The spaced repetition algorithm Anki uses is
    a modified version of SM2, an algorithm created for SuperMemo in the late
    1980s. Anki’s greatest strength is its flexibility and customizability. It
    runs on all major platforms (desktop and mobile, online and local), allows
    for easy importing and exporting, and has built-in syncing. Anki gives users
    the freedom to fully customize the design and organization of their cards,
    and even allows for modifications to the program itself in the form of
    add-ons. Add-ons and pre-made decks created by other users can be found on
    the Anki website. Anki’s other advantage is that, with the exception of Anki
    Mobile for iOS, it’s 100% free. Anki’s downside is that it requires a large
    amount of learning and modification to be used optimally. The extensive
    customizability can be overwhelming for new users, causing many to become
    frustrated and give up before fully adjusting to the program. Furthermore,
    Anki’s algorithm is simplistic and counterintuitive, and this leads many
    users to improperly grade cards and greatly hurt the effectiveness of the
    algorithm. This is exacerbated by the default algorithm settings being
    borderline nonsensical (Maximum reviews/day set to 200, New Interval set to
    0%, etc.) Anki is MIA’s recommended SRS. The main reasons for this are the
    accessibility (it’s free and runs on all platforms), customizability (cards
    can be designed to fit the precise needs of the individual), and the many
    useful language-learning tools that have been created specifically for Anki,
    such as
    <nuxt-link to="http://subs2srs.sourceforge.net/" rel="noopener"
      >subs2srs</nuxt-link
    >
    and
    <nuxt-link to="https://github.com/FooSoft/yomichan" rel="noopener"
      >Yomichan</nuxt-link
    >. MIA seeks to remedy Anki’s flaws by helping learners gain an in-depth
    understanding of the program such that they can use it optimally.

    <h2 id="MT">Multi-Target Sentence</h2>
    <strong>Also known as:</strong> MT sentence. A sentence that contains more
    than one unknown word or grammar structure. In other words, a sentence with
    multiple target words/structures.

    <h2 id="1T">One-Target Sentence</h2>
    <strong>Also known as:</strong> 1T sentence, single-target sentence. A
    sentence that contains one unknown word or grammar structure. The unknown
    word or structure is referred to as the "target word" or "target structure".
    A sentence is only considered to be 1T if, after looking up or inferring the
    meaning of the unknown word/structure, the overall meaning of the sentence
    becomes clear. If a sentence contains one unknown word/structure, but the
    overall meaning remains unclear even after looking up the target
    word/structure, the sentence is not considered to be 1T. Learning through 1T
    sentences can be thought of as "picking low-hanging fruit". It makes the
    target word/structure easy to understand and retain. As you continue to
    learn, sentences that were previously one-target will become zero-target,
    and sentences that were previously multi-target will become one-target. In
    this way, one-target sentences can take you all the way to fluency.

    <strong>Note</strong>: Previously, MIA referred to "1T sentences" as "i+1
    sentences". The term "i+1" comes from Stephen Krashen and his Input
    Hypothesis. From
    <nuxt-link
      to="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis"
      rel="noopener"
      >Wikipedia</nuxt-link
    >: "[The Input Hypothesis] states that learners progress in their knowledge
    of the language when they comprehend language input that is slightly more
    advanced than their current level. Krashen called this level of input "i+1",
    where "i" is the learner's interlanguage and "+1" is the next stage of
    language acquisition." In other words, Krashen's "i+1" refers to input that
    is immediately comprehensible to the unconscious language acquisition
    device. On the other hand, MIA was using the term to refer to input that
    could be consciously comprehended after looking up or inferring the meaning
    of an unknown word or structure. In order to avoid confusion due to this
    slight difference in meaning, we decided to drop the term and adopt the more
    straightforward "one target" instead.

    <h2 id="0T">Zero-Target Sentence</h2>
    <strong>Also known as:</strong> 0T Sentence. A sentence that doesn't contain
    any unknown words or grammar structures. In other words, a sentence without
    a target word or target structure. If you know all the words/structures
    contained in a sentence but still can't understand the overall meaning, the
    sentence is still considered to be zero-target.
