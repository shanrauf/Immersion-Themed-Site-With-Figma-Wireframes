    <h2>The Fluency Illusion</h2>
    <YouTubeEmbed src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vnGOrXh1dvY" />

    <h1>Video Summary</h1>
    If you’re a beginner (or any level, really) in a foreign language, up to
    what point are you able to judge someone’s language ability? The answer to
    this question is simple: You can only judge ability up to your own level.
    Any further than that, and you can’t perceive the mistakes. You don’t know
    what you don’t know.
    <h1>The Fluency Illusion</h1>
    If you’ve been following so far, you already pretty much understand what the
    fluency illusion is. Basically, it’s whenever someone appears to be much
    better at a foreign language then they actually are. This is very likely to
    occur when you’re listening to a foreign language speaker who is much better
    than you.
    <h1>When Laymen Try To Judge Language Ability</h1>
    The most clear example of the fluency illusion happens when a layman (in
    this case, someone who doesn’t speak the language of concern) tries to judge
    another speaker’s ability. Now, for the past few years I’ve dabbled in
    Mandarin Chinese. I’m still god-awful at it—I can hardly understand
    anything. But, if I went to a Chinese restaurant with my family—and started
    speaking in Chinese with a Chinese waiter—I’d appear totally fluent to my
    family. The reason for that, of course, is that my family has no way to
    perceive mistakes in the language. They can only judge the atmosphere of the
    conversation, and my own apparent ability to talk with the waiter without
    creating any misunderstandings. All factors that mean very little. I would
    be able to hide my own discomfort, and the chinese waiter would also lower
    the difficulty of his speech to accomodate me.
    <h1>Judging Language Ability At Higher Levels</h1>
    As I said earlier, the fluency illusion can happen at any level. Thinking
    back to a few years ago, when I wasn’t as fluent in Japanese (but still
    quite fluent), there were some foreign speakers of Japanese that appeared
    perfect to me. However, now that I’ve improved, I can notice quite
    frequently when their speech—grammar, pronunciation, and phrasing—deviate
    from native speech. I can see now that they’re struggling at a very subtle
    level.
    <h1>The Takeaway For Beginners and Intermediates</h1>
    There are a lot of people out there who say they’re at a very high level in
    a foreign language. Maybe they have a lot of videos too. To anyone below
    their level, they will sound really good—maybe even perfect. But in reality,
    they could easily be using words wrong, making grammar and pronunciation
    mistakes left and right—and you won’t be able to tell at all. Never trust
    your instincts when it comes to how good someone is in a language. If you
    can’t perceive mistakes, it doesn’t mean there aren't any mistakes being
    made.
