      <p>
        As language learners, we need to be able to talk about different levels
        of ability. It's what allows us to set concrete goals, measure how
        effective different methods are, and determine how qualified someone is
        to give advice. Yet, in my opinion, we still don’t have an adequate
        system for discussing language ability in a nuanced and technical way.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this point, it's already a cliché to complain that the terms
        "fluency" and "native level" are too vague to be helpful. Everyone's
        definition of "fluency" is different, and not all native speakers are at
        the same level of ability. Systems such as CEFR or JALUP's "Levels" are
        big steps up, as they provide a full continuum of well-defined levels,
        rather than a simple binary. But these systems are still extremely
        limited in that they don't account for the multi-faceted nature of
        language ability. What if you can write academic articles in a language,
        but don't have enough verbal fluency to hold a conversation? What if
        you're a native speaker who never learned how to read? What if your
        overall linguistic competence exceeds most native speakers, but you
        speak with a thick foreign accent? These models can't account for such
        imbalances in the different aspects of ability. And because almost
        everyone is imbalanced in one way or another, this constitutes a big
        problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        And this problem isn't easy to solve, as there is no obvious way of
        defining what counts as a separate "aspect" of language ability. For
        example, we could break "speaking ability" into "pronunciation,"
        "grammar," and "word choice." We could also further divide
        "pronunciation" into "timbre" (pronunciation of vowels and consonants),
        "stress accent/pitch accent/tones," and "intonation". Or maybe "cadence"
        and "flow" should be given their own categories as well. And maybe how
        much "flow" someone can speak with depends on how familiar they are with
        a topic, so we might want "flow when speaking about a familiar topic"
        and "flow when speaking about an unfamiliar topic". Or do we need "flow
        when speaking about a semi-familiar topic" as well? As you can see,
        there is a virtually unlimited number of different categories that we
        could hypothetically slice and dice language ability into. The more
        distinct categories we create, the greater detail we will be able to
        describe language ability with. But more distinct categories also mean a
        more complicated and convoluted model. If the model is too complicated,
        it will be confusing, cumbersome, and therefore effectively useless.
      </p>

      <p>
        The problem is further complicated by the fact that many aspects of
        "language ability" exist on a continuum alongside skills that are
        seemingly unrelated to language. For example, it's hard to draw a clear
        line between "speaking ability" and "social skills," or "vocabulary" and
        "knowledge" (is not knowing the difference between a "lunar eclipse" and
        a "solar eclipse" an issue of scientific knowledge, vocabulary, or
        both?) We also must take into account that judgments about linguistic
        ability are often inherently subjective. For example, let's say we
        decide that someone who strings words together in a creative and elegant
        way is "better" at speaking than the average person… How exactly do we
        measure how "creative" and "elegant" someone's speech is?
      </p>

      <p>
        After taking all the above into consideration, I created what I call the
        "6-Point Model of Language Ability." In this model, language ability is
        first broken down into "spoken language ability" and "written language
        ability," and then each of these two categories are further divided into
        six distinct aspects of ability. Each category is rated on a one-to-ten
        scale, ten being the hypothetical peak of that aspect of ability.
      </p>

      <img
        src="https://massimmersionapproach.com/imgs/2019/01/blank_graph.svg"
        alt=""
        width="500"
        height="400"
      />
      <h1 id="considerations">Considerations</h1>
      <p>
        Before I jump into the details of the different categories, let me touch
        on a few broader points about the model:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In order to be applicable to both native speakers and learners alike,
          the model is set up in such a way that the average native speaker
          won't receive a perfect score in any category. For the model to be
          comprehensive, a perfect score must signify the hypothetical peak of
          ability in that category, so it wouldn't make sense to base it on the
          level of the average speaker. For example, we would expect a
          professional voice actor to be able to give a much better vocal
          performance than someone with no vocal training, so if the model was
          calibrated so that the average person received a perfect score in
          Delivery, then the model wouldn't be able to quantify the
          <em>difference</em> in ability between a professional voice actor and
          the average person.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each category of ability is comprised of a myriad of smaller, more
          specific abilities (micro-abilities), which can each develop
          independently from one another. This means that rating a given aspect
          may not always be completely straightforward. An extreme example might
          be someone who is a phenomenal public speaker but profusely stutters
          in one-on-one conversations. How would we rate their Delivery?
          Although it may be tricky, in cases like these, try to average the
          major micro-abilities that comprise the category to come up with an
          overall score.
        </li>
        <li>
          As a category of ability develops, the range of micro-abilities that
          comprise that category become broader. For example, at the lower
          levels, Phrasing develops along a relatively straightforward path
          (becoming increasingly able to use words and phrases in natural and
          idiomatic ways). But at the higher levels, when Phrasing becomes about
          using words in the most skillful or elegant ways possible, development
          branches off into countless specific domains of language, such as
          giving a formal speech, creating an engaging YouTube video, or being a
          standup comedian.
        </li>
        <li>
          Development at these highest levels is mainly about truly excelling in
          the limited number of domains most relevant to the person. Even if
          other domains that aren't relevant to the person remain at a more
          average level, that shouldn't negatively affect their rating. This may
          seem to contradict what I said above, but the difference is<em>
            whether a micro-ability is relevant to the person or not</em
          >. Everyday conversation is a domain that is relevant to nearly
          everyone, so if someone can't speak to other people face-to-face, that
          would negatively affect their score. On the other hand, if a
          world-class motivational speaker couldn’t control their voice as well
          as a standup comedian, that wouldn't affect their score, as that
          specific micro-ability wouldn't be required by any of the domains
          relevant to the person.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reaching the highest levels of development in a certain category may
          require development in other categories as a prerequisite. For
          example, a certain level of development in Pronunciation is necessary
          to reach the highest levels of Delivery possible.
        </li>
        <li>
          Although the model breaks language ability down into various
          categories, that isn't meant to imply that each category is equally
          important, or that someone must be at a high level in every category
          to be considered a competent user of a language. The relative
          importance of each category will differ depending on the specific
          goals and priorities of the individual, and in some cases, certain
          categories may be given little to no importance at all.
        </li>
        <li>
          Applying the model to specific individuals will require a significant
          amount of subjective judgment. This is inevitable, as there is no
          ultimate authority to refer to when thinking critically about language
          use, and much of what people find "skillful," "ideal," or "good" boils
          down to personal preference.
        </li>
        <li>
          At the end of the day, it's just a model. By definition, a model is a
          <em>representation</em> of reality, so some amount of detail is
          inevitably going to be lost when compared to reality itself. The model
          is meant to be a pragmatic tool for thinking about language ability,
          not the end-all-be-all description of someone's capacity to use
          language.
        </li>
        <li>
          I am sure that the model has many flaws that I was not able to
          foresee. I plan on continuing to update the model as these flaws are
          made aware to me.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1 id="rubric">Rubric</h1>
      <p>
        In order to make applying the model as clear and straightforward as
        possible, I have created a detailed rubric which specifies the
        differences between each possible score in each of the categories. I
        made the rubric in Google Sheets for easy viewing and editing. And
        because the details of the rubric are subject to change as flaws in the
        model are discovered, I have decided to keep the rubric hosted on Google
        Sheets for the time being. This way, I don’t have to worry about keeping
        it up to date in multiple places.
      </p>

      />
      <h3>Comprehension</h3>
      <p>
        The extent to which one can understand messages communicated through
        vocal and nonverbal language. Nonverbal language includes things like
        gestures and body language, which native speakers regularly use to
        communicate ideas both directly and indirectly. Comprehension is the one
        aspect of language ability that isn't related to producing language.
        Comprehension can be thought of in terms of accuracy, ease, and range.
        Native speakers tend to understand very close to 100% of the kinds of
        language that they are regularly exposed, so we could say that within
        the range of what they are comfortable with, their accuracy is close to
        100%. Native speakers also usually find that understanding the kinds of
        language that they are comfortable with doesn't require any effort; what
        is heard is automatically and instantaneously understood. So, we could
        also say that native speakers can understand familiar kinds of language
        with great ease. Range refers to the spectrum of different language
        domains that can be understood, and is likely to differ significantly
        between native speakers. For example, someone who didn't graduate from
        high school may have a hard time understanding a high-level lecture by a
        verbose college professor.
      </p>

      <p>
        Comprehension can also be thought of in terms of "phoneme-parsing
        ability" and "processing ability." "Phoneme-parsing ability" is the
        ability to determine which vowels and consonants (and by extension,
        which words) were actually spoken. For example, second language speakers
        often have a hard time making out what a fast-paced native speaker is
        saying, even though they might have no trouble understanding if they
        were given a written transcript of what was said. "Processing ability"
        is the ability to put together the words that are spoken in order to
        understand the message that is being communicated. In the example above,
        although the high school drop-out would be able to clearly hear what
        words the verbose college professor was saying, they still wouldn’t be
        able to comprehend the message, due to not having a large enough passive
        vocabulary and knowledge of concepts.. In this way, knowledge of
        concepts is directly related to Comprehension ability. Inferential
        ability (the ability to use what you do understand to fill in the gaps
        of what you don’t understand) can be considered part of "processing
        ability" as well.
      </p>

      <h3>Grammar</h3>
      <p>
        The extent to which the syntax used in speech is consistent with what is
        considered natural and correct by the majority of native speakers of the
        variety of the language that is being spoken. Grammar is something that
        second language speakers tend to struggle with much more than native
        speakers, but native speakers still slip up now and again. Native
        speakers will often make spontaneous grammatical errors due to getting
        tongue tied in the midst of conversation. In such cases, they will
        usually be fully aware of errors. Other times, native speakers will
        consistently break some generally accepted descriptive grammar rules.
        For example, although "me and Matt" may be consistent with some native
        speakers' grammar, those speakers may look uneducated if they used that
        instead of "Matt and I" in formal situations.
      </p>
      <h3>Phrasing</h3>
      <p>
        The extent to which words, phrases, and expressions are used skillfully
        in speech. Phrasing is equally relevant to both native and second
        language speakers. At the lower end of the spectrum, Phrasing is about
        whether usage would be considered natural and correct by the majority of
        native speakers of the variety of the language spoken. For example, "he
        said a lie," although grammatically correct, would be considered
        unnatural by nearly all native English speakers. Around the middle range
        of the spectrum, Phrasing becomes about using language that is
        appropriately tailored to the situation. For example, speaking with the
        right amount of formality in a business meeting. At the high end of the
        spectrum, Phrasing becomes about using language in exceptionally
        creative, clever, entertaining, elegant, or poetic ways. At the highest
        levels, Phrasing transitions into art. And as with all forms of art,
        value judgements become inherently subjective. At the lower end of the
        spectrum, distinguishing between Phrasing and Grammar is
        straightforward: Grammar is accuracy with regards to syntax rules, and
        Phrasing is accuracy with regards to word usage. "He told a lies" is an
        error in Grammar, whereas "He said a lie" is an error in Phrasing. But,
        a high level of development in Grammar is practically a prerequisite for
        reaching the higher end of the Phrasing spectrum, so making a strict
        distinction between the two can become difficult.
      </p>

      <h3>Pronunciation</h3>
      <p>
        The extent to which the timbre (vowels and consonants), pitch
        accent/stress accent/tones, and intonation of speech deviate from what
        is considered to be natural and correct by the majority of native
        speakers of the variety of the language spoken. Said another way,
        <em
          >when reading a text out loud, how close does the person sound to a
          native speaker?</em
        >
        Because Pronunciation is mainly a matter of not deviating from native
        speakers, it is most relevant to second language speakers. That said,
        many native speakers will still mispronounce words from time to time.
        For example, let's say a native speaker learns a word from reading and
        incorrectly guesses the spoken pronunciation and then uses that
        mispronunciation in speech. This could be an entirely idiosyncratic
        deviation from all other native speakers of the language. Native
        speakers with speech impediments may struggle with pronunciation as
        well.
      </p>

      <p>
        If multiple varieties of the language exist (for example, American
        English, British English, etc.), scores should be based on the amount of
        deviation from the specific variety of the language that the person’s
        speech most closely resembles. Speakers who are a perfect mix of
        multiple varieties of a language may be difficult to score.
      </p>
      <h3>Delivery</h3>
      <p>
        The extent to which the verbal performance and body language of a
        speaker either enhances, or subtracts from, the experience of listening
        to that speaker. Delivery is equally relevant to both native and second
        language speakers. Some examples of qualities that would subtract from a
        speaker's Delivery are stuttering, overuse of filler words, mumbling,
        hesitation, awkward or unnatural body language, a sense of being
        strained or tensed up, speaking too fast or too slow, and constantly
        restarting sentences mid-way through. Some examples of qualities that
        would enhance a speaker's Delivery are an engaging and easy to
        understand cadence, an ideal amount of enunciation, an appropriate
        amount of confidence, and a sense of flow or effortlessness.
      </p>

      <p>
        Delivery is independent from Pronunciation, Grammar, Phrasing, and
        Content. If two native speakers read the same text out loud, and one
        speaker was easier to understand and more pleasant to listen to than the
        other, that would be a difference in Delivery. Thought of another way,
        it is possible for a second language speaker to have poor Pronunciation,
        Grammar, and Phrasing, yet still have great Delivery.
      </p>
      <h3>Content</h3>
      <p>
        The extent to which messages verbally and nonverbally communicated are
        skillful. Whereas Phrasing is about <em>words</em>, Content is about
        <em>ideas</em>. Content is the most subjective category of language
        ability, as well as the category that most greatly diverges from what is
        traditionally thought of as "language ability." Content is equally
        relevant to both native and second language speakers.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the lower end of the spectrum, Content is about assimilating into a
        linguistically-bounded group of people through following cultural and
        societal norms. For example, in Japanese culture, accepting compliments
        is highly frowned upon; when complimented, playing down or denying the
        compliment is considered to be the appropriate reaction. Consistently
        complying with all these sorts of cultural norms (with the exception of
        intentionally breaking one in order to make a point) puts one at least
        at the mid-range of Content related ability. Development in this area
        will often have a greater influence on how a second language speaker is
        perceived by native speakers than improvements in the more technical
        aspects of language ability.
      </p>

      <p>
        At the high end of the spectrum, Content becomes about conveying
        messages that strongly influence other people. Some examples might be
        making people laugh, educating or informing, or providing encouragement
        or inspiration. The influence that a speaker exerts doesn't necessarily
        have to be <em>positive</em>, but it does have to be
        <em>intentional</em>. For example, accidently making someone laugh would
        not reflect a high level of development in Content.
      </p>

      <p>
        This high end of the Content spectrum covers an extremely broad range
        and is decidedly subjective. But, language is a tool to interact and
        communicate with other people, and so the ability to
        <em>produce language that affects listeners in </em>a desired<em>
          way</em
        >
        clearly must be taken into account. And because the actual Content that
        is communicated is undeniably the largest deciding factor in how
        language will affect someone, Content must be included in a
        comprehensive model of language ability.

        The extent to which one can understand messages communicated through
        written language. Similar to Comprehension in spoken language, except
        "phoneme-parsing ability" (the ability to determine which vowels and
        consonants were actually spoken) is not relevant, so only "processing
        ability" (the ability to put together words in order to understand the
        message that is being communicated) is required.
      </p>

      <p>
        In written language, Comprehension can be thought of in terms of
        accuracy, speed, ease, and range. Native users of a language tend to
        understand very close to 100% of the language domains they regularly
        read in, so we could say that within the range of what they are
        comfortable with, native users’ accuracy is close to 100%. Native users
        also usually find that they can read in the language domains they are
        most comfortable in relatively quickly, and without a large amount of
        effort. Thus, we could also say that native users can read familiar
        kinds of language with a high level of speed and ease. Range refers to
        the spectrum of different language domains that can be understood, and
        is likely to differ significantly between native users. For example,
        someone who didn't graduate from high school may have a hard time
        understanding a philosophy thesis. Knowledge of concepts, as well as
        inferential ability (the ability to use what you do understand to fill
        in the gaps of what you don’t understand), are directly related to
        Comprehension ability.
      </p>

      <h3>Grammar</h3>
      <p>
        The extent to which the syntax used in writing is consistent with what
        is considered natural and correct by the majority of native users of the
        variety of the language that is being written. Largely the same as
        Grammar in Spoken Language Ability. Grammar is something that second
        language users tend to struggle with much more than native users, but
        most native users still slip up now and again. Instead of making
        spontaneous syntax errors due to getting tongue tied like in spoken
        language, when writing, native users often make spontaneous syntax
        errors due to typos, but are able to notice and self-correct these
        errors when re-reading what they wrote. Similar to spoken language, some
        native users will consistently break some generally accepted descriptive
        grammar rules. For example, although "me and Matt" may be consistent
        with some native speakers' grammar, those users would look uneducated if
        they used that instead of "Matt and I" in formal writing.
      </p>

      <h3>Phrasing</h3>
      <p>
        The extent to which words, phrases, and expressions are used skillfully
        in writing. Largely the same as Phrasing in Spoken Language Ability.
        Phrasing is equally relevant to both native and second language users.
        At the lower end of the spectrum, Phrasing is about whether usage would
        be considered natural and correct by the majority of native users of the
        variety of the language written in. For example, "he said a lie,"
        although grammatically correct, would be considered unnatural by nearly
        all native English users. Around the middle range of the spectrum,
        Phrasing becomes about using language that is appropriately tailored to
        the situation. For example, writing with the appropriate amount of
        formality in a business email. At the high end of the spectrum, Phrasing
        becomes about using language in exceptionally creative, clever,
        entertaining, elegant, or poetic ways. At the highest levels, Phrasing
        transitions into art. And as with all forms of art, value judgements
        become inherently subjective. At the lower end of the spectrum,
        distinguishing between Phrasing and Grammar is straightforward: Grammar
        is accuracy with regards to syntax rules, and Phrasing is accuracy with
        regards to word usage. "He told a lies" is an error in Grammar, whereas
        "He said a lie" is an error in Phrasing. But, a high level of
        development in Grammar is practically a prerequisite for reaching the
        higher end of the Phrasing spectrum, so making a strict distinction
        between the two can become difficult.
      </p>

      <h3>Hand Writing</h3>
      <p>
        The extent to which written Handwriting is legible and aesthetically
        pleasing. This category only applies when using a pen or pencil to write
        language out by hand. Judgements about Handwriting are largely
        subjective. Although having good handwriting was valued by many cultures
        in the past, due to the advent and proliferation of typing and digital
        text, in recent years its perceived value has waned immensely. Many
        people do not place any value on Handwriting when thinking about the big
        picture of writing ability.
      </p>

      <h3>Conventions</h3>
      <p>
        The extent to which the Conventions agreed-upon by native users of the
        variety of the language written are adhered to. "Conventions" include
        things like spelling and punctuation use. I have also placed the
        frequency of typos into this category. Technology has made it much
        easier to get by without having a detailed knowledge of Conventions.
        Judgements about competence in Conventions should be based on one's
        level when <em>not</em> relying on technology. For example, kanji
        knowledge in Japanese should be based on the ability to recall
        characters from Memory. Ability related to
        <em>reading and understanding</em> kanji would fall under Comprehension.
        Because technology is increasingly replacing knowledge of Conventions
        for many people, and Conventions are largely independent from the rest
        of Written Language Ability, many people may not place a lot of emphasis
        on Conventions when thinking about the big picture of writing ability.
      </p>

      <h3>Content</h3>
      <p>
        The extent to which messages communicated through writing are skillful.
        Largely the same as Content in Spoken Language Ability. Whereas Phrasing
        is about <em>words</em>, Content is about <em>ideas</em>. Content is the
        most subjective aspect of language ability, as well as the aspect that
        most greatly diverges from what is traditionally thought of as "language
        ability." Content is equally relevant to both native and second language
        users. At the lower end of the spectrum, Content is about assimilating
        into a linguistically-bounded group of people through following cultural
        and societal norms. At the high end of the spectrum, Content becomes
        about conveying messages that strongly influence other people. Some
        examples might be entertaining, educating, inspiring, or motivating
        people. The influence that a user exerts doesn't necessarily have to be
        <em>positive</em>, but it does have to be <em>intentional</em>. This
        high end of the Content spectrum covers an extremely broad range and is
        decidedly subjective. But, language is a tool to interact and
        communicate with other people, and so the ability to
        <em>produce language that affects listeners in </em>a desired<em>
          way</em
        >
        clearly must be taken into account. And because the actual Content that
        is communicated is undeniably the largest deciding factor in how
        language will affect someone, Content must be included in a
        comprehensive model of language ability.

      <h2 id="fluency">Defining Fluency</h2>
      <p>
        So, now that we have a nuanced working model of language ability, how
        are we going to define fluency? Of course, we can’t hope for a
        be-all-end-all definition, as the word means something different to
        everyone. But in the context of MIA, the minimum criteria to be
        considered “fluent” is as follows:
      </p>
      <p><strong>Spoken Language:</strong></p>
      <img
        src="https://massimmersionapproach.com/imgs/2019/01/spoken_fluency.svg"

        height="400"
      />
      <p><strong>Written Language:</strong></p>

        width="500"
        height="400"
      />

      <p>
        In the charts above, each rung represents “two” of the ten possible
        points (i.e., Grammar is “six”). You can make your own ability graphs
        <a
          href="https://frenchyann.github.io/language-aptitude-graphs/"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener"
          >with this tool</a
        >. Here is a chart that compares fluency (blue) to the minimum amount of
        ability required to reliably get confused for a native speaker (purple):
      </p>

      <strong>Spoken Language:</strong>

      <img
        src="https://massimmersionapproach.com/imgs/2019/01/spoken_native.svg"
        alt=""
        width="500"
        height="400"
      />

      <strong>Written Language:</strong>

      <img
        src="https://massimmersionapproach.com/imgs/2019/01/written_native.svg"
        alt=""
        width="500"
        height="400"
      />

      <p>
        Although I would argue that you could still consistently get confused
        for a native speaker with only a “2” in Delivery, because this low of a
        level would significantly get in the way of fluent communication, I made
        “3” the minimum requirement for spoken language fluency. On the other
        hand, although I didn’t make development in Handwriting a requirement
        for written language fluency (as it is largely irrelevant in modern
        times), I would argue that nearly all natives could score least “4” in
        this category. Below you will find examples of the model applied to
        second language speakers of English and Japanese at various levels. The
        full extent of a speaker’s Comprehension and Content can’t be accurately
        judged from a single video, so I have left these categories blank.
        Please note that all scores are based on my own subjective opinion,
        which I formed after watching the video in question. These scores are
        for strictly educational purposes and are not meant to be taken as
        criticism of the speakers in question.
