    <h1>Part 1: Effective vs. Ineffective Methods</h1>

    Note: what I meant to say at the end is that it's not contradictory to say
    that it <strong>MAY</strong> be the case that, while there are universal
    principals of language acquisition that are true for everyone, certain
    specific methods may be more cut out for some people than for others.
    <h1>Part 2: Avoiding “Universally Ineffective” Methods</h1>

    I forgot to clearly state that, when “testing” people who are giving out
    language learning advice, the thing to really look for is whether said
    person has<strong>
      achieved what you are specifically hoping to accomplish</strong
    >. In other words, if you want to accomplish “x”, only take advice from
    people who have successfully accomplished “x”. A corollary of this is that,
    even if someone hasn’t reached the highest possible levels of foreign
    language mastery, as long as they have reached a level you would be happy
    with, their advice may be worth listening to. Something else I forgot to
    mention is that another reason you can’t trust people’s self-reports about
    their own language ability is the

      target="_blank"
      rel="noopener noreferrer"
      >Dunning–Kruger effect</a
    >. The Dunning–Kruger effect is a cognitive bias in which, for any given
    skill, people at relatively low levels tend to overestimate their ability,
    due to not being competent enough to recognize their own incompetence. In
    language learning, this often manifests as intermediate language learners
    believing they have reached a very high level in a language, due to
    comparing themselves to other language learners. When these intermediate
    learners begin to reach a more advanced level, they usually transition to
    comparing their ability to that of native speakers and realize that their
    level is actually quite low. For more on the Dunning–Kruger effect, I highly
    recommend

    >. And lastly, I am no exception to these principles! Don’t just blindly
    assume I know what I’m talking about! Go “test” me as well as other popular
    figures in the language learning community. I want you to have confidence
    that the methods I talk about on this site are proven to work. You can find
    videos of me speaking Japanese

    especially if you ever run into an issue that MIA doesn’t seem to provide a
    specific solution for. Even when using the best methods, it’s important to
    take personal responsibility for your learning and results.
