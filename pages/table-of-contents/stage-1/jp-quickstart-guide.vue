      <h1 id="immersion">Immersion</h1>
      <p>
        Immersion refers to any form of listening or reading in your target
        language. As the name Mass <em>Immersion</em> Approach might suggest,
        it’s the absolute most important component of the entire process. Thus,
        acquiring immersion content and beginning to immerse is the very first
        step to learning Japanese with MIA. Immersion then continues throughout
        every step of the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong
          >Even if you don’t know a single word of Japanese, immersion in the
          form of listening will still be of great benefit to you</strong
        >. The reason for this is that, when you first approach a new foreign
        language, your brain won’t yet be able to parse the sounds. The language
        will sound like one big blur of noise, instead of crisp consonants and
        vowels grouped into words. By simply listening to your target language,
        your brain will slowly get better at parsing the sounds. Eventually,
        you’ll start naturally picking out common words. This is the start of
        cultivating listening ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand,
        <strong
          >no matter how many words you’ve memorized, without actually listening
          to the language for hundreds of hours, you will understand close to
          nothing</strong
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might be surprised at how much you can learn from simply watching a
        Japanese TV show with no subtitles. Your unconscious mind is a pattern
        recognition machine. Once you start exposing it to Japanese, it will
        immediately get to work decoding the sound system, grammar, and lexicon
        of the language. You’ll slowly start understanding more and more, but
        won’t be able to explain why. This is the counter-intuitive mechanism of
        language acquisition. It might be something that’s hard to fully grasp
        until you’ve started experiencing it for yourself.
      </p>
      <h2 id="listening-vs-reading">Listening vs. Reading</h2>
      <p>
        MIA makes a distinction between <em>listening</em> and <em>reading</em>.
        Listening refers to consuming both strictly audio content, such as
        podcasts and audiobooks, as well as audio-video content, such as TV
        shows and YouTube videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning, we recommend focusing on listening rather than
        reading. The reason for this is that, when you first start, you
        inevitably aren’t going to understand much. When you don’t understand
        much, it’s much easier to enjoy and learn from audio/visual content than
        text-based content.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, watching content with Japanese subtitles is a great way to
        introduce yourself to the written language. As we will talk about later
        in this section, we recommend watching with Japanese subtitles right
        from the beginning. Once you build a foundation in the language, phase
        out Japanese subtitles and replace them with reading fully text-based
        content, such as manga or novels.
      </p>
      <h2 id="types-of-immersion">
        Different Types of Listening Immersion
      </h2>
      <p>
        The following video explains the concepts of<em> active listening</em>,
        <em>passive listening</em>, and <em>background listening</em>, and how
        they relate to each other:
      </p>
      <YouTubeEmbed src="https://youtube.com/embed/SSWabajK1Sc" />

      <p>
        <strong>NOTE</strong>: The terms used in the above video have been
        changed to the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Active listening → Active listening (no change)</li>
        <li>Partially active listening → Passive listening</li>
        <li>Passive listening → Background listening</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        MIA also uses the term <em>active immersion</em> to refer to “active
        listening and reading”. Because “passive reading” isn’t really possible,
        MIA considers all reading to be a form of active immersion.
      </p>
      <h2 id="choosing-content">Choosing Immersion Content</h2>
      <p>
        You can really use anything for your immersion content, as long as it
        was
        <strong>made by Japanese people, for Japanese people</strong>. It’s best
        to avoid content that has been artificially dumbed-down for learners;
        you need to train your brain to parse real, native speech. You learned
        your first language this way, and you can learn Japanese this way as
        well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some other things to take into account are enjoyment and
        comprehensibility. You’re going to be doing a lot of immersion, so it’s
        crucial that you enjoy it. Anything boring has to go. And in general,
        you can learn more easily when you have some idea of what’s going on.
        That being said, in the beginning, try not to get too hung up on
        understanding stuff. When you first start out, pretty much nothing is
        going to be comprehensible, so we recommend mainly focusing on finding
        content that’s engaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some other guidelines for how to choose immersion content are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          In the beginning, content that has a visual component, such as YouTube
          videos, dramas, and movies, are much easier to learn from. If you try
          listening to a podcast or audiobook as a beginner, you’ll likely have
          no idea what’s going on.
        </li>
        <li>
          Content with an ongoing narrative, such as anime or dramas, can be
          easier to learn from. Once you get familiar with the characters and
          settings, following the plot will become much easier, even if you’re
          not understanding much.
        </li>
        <li>
          Try to find content that you’re interested in. If you like anime,
          watch anime. If you like baseball, watch Japanese baseball. Also watch
          anime, J-drama, J-movies, and Japanese YouTube videos
          <em>about</em> baseball.
        </li>
        <li>
          Re-watch Japanese content you’ve watched with English subtitles in the
          past. This way, you’ll know what’s going on even if you’re not
          understanding much.
        </li>
        <li>
          Read English summaries of content you plan on consuming ahead of time
          in order to increase comprehensibility. If you’re watching a movie,
          try reading a summary of the plot on Wikipedia. If you’re watching an
          anime or drama, look for short episode summaries on Wikipedia. If
          you’re watching something on Netflix, there are short summaries
          directly pinned to each episode.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="subtitles">Should I Use Subtitles?</h2>
      <p>
        In general, if you’re reading subtitles, you’re not actively listening.
        This is true for both English subtitles and Japanese subtitles. Actively
        watching Japanese content with English subtitles is equivalent to
        passive listening at best.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that said, if you’re completely new to the Japanese language and
        have zero background in consuming Japanese media, it may be a good idea
        to start out with English subtitles, at least some of the time. The most
        important thing is that you don’t quit. So, if jumping straight into raw
        Japanese content is too intimidating, then, by all means, start with
        English subs. But, see them as something to quickly outgrow, and try to
        slowly wean yourself off of them. Although it may seem counter-intuitive
        at first, you’ll actually learn much more from “understanding close to
        nothing while watching raw” than you will from “seemingly understanding
        everything while watching with English subs”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we have Japanese subtitles. In our view, watching with Japanese
        subtitles is closer to reading than listening. This is because true
        listening involves deducing what words are being spoken from audio
        alone. So, in a way, watching with Japanese subs is like solving a math
        problem by copying the answer from the back of the textbook. For this
        reason, in general, MIA considers “watching with Japanese subtitles” to
        be a form of reading.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the same time, Japanese subtitles are perhaps the best way to get
        familiar with written Japanese. Right from the start, they can help you
        consolidate kana and kanji, and allow you to notice new patterns in the
        written language. For this reason, we recommend starting to use Japanese
        subs as soon as you learn kana. That said,<strong>
          aim to spend at least half of your active immersion time not using any
          subtitles at all</strong
        >. That active listening practice is important.
      </p>
      <h2 id="looking-things-up">Should I Look Things Up?</h2>
      <p>
        Yes,<strong> if you feel like it</strong>. If a word pops out at you
        while listening to Japanese, oftentimes, looking it up once will be
        enough to permanently remember it. So, if you think you heard a word
        clearly enough to look it up and find it in a dictionary, consider
        giving it a go. But, never feel obligated to look things up. Attempting
        to look up too many words will put you on the fast track to burnout.
        Successful language learning requires consistency in the long term, so
        immersing in a way that’s sustainable should always be the top priority.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be specific, while immersing, we suggest aiming to look up a word
        <strong>once every few minutes</strong>. Unless, that is, you simply
        don’t feel like looking anything up at all. In that case, it’s perfectly
        fine to just sit back, relax and enjoy your immersion.
      </p>

        When you should add things to Anki will be discussed in the

        look things up are listed in the

      </p>
      <h2 id="what-should-i-be-doing">
        What Should I Actually Be Doing While Actively Listening?
      </h2>
      <p>
        Like we mentioned at the beginning of this guide, when you first start
        listening to a foreign language, you won’t even be able to hear where
        one word ends and another begins. So, in the beginning, it can be useful
        to simply pay attention to the sounds of the language, without worrying
        too much about meaning. By actively trying to hear individual vowels and
        consonants as clearly as possible, you’ll speed up the process of your
        brain decoding the Japanese sound system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once your brain gets a handle on the sound system, many words will
        naturally start popping out at you. Once you reach this stage, try to
        focus on picking out as many individual words as possible. If you hear a
        new word clearly enough that you feel you might be able to look it up,
        consider doing so (see the previous subheading).
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the following video may provide some useful pointers for
        the right mindset to approach immersion with:
      </p>
      <YouTubeEmbed src="https://youtube.com/embed/5xG-WwqhHBc" />

      <p>
        As the video above hints at, learning to
        <em>tolerate ambiguity</em> is an important part of the immersion
        process. As adults, we’re used to understanding nearly everything we’re
        exposed to. Because of this, putting yourself in a situation where
        you’re not entirely sure what’s going on can feel jarring. But this is
        simply par for the course in language learning. The only way to reach a
        point of true understanding is to first go through a lot of
        <em>not</em> understanding. So, learning to make peace with ambiguity is
        an essential skill for a language learner. It can also be a useful
        exercise in learning to feel okay outside your comfort zone in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another problem people often run into is that as they improve in their
        target language, they quickly acclimate to their new ability and shift
        their focus back to what they still
        <em>can’t</em> understand. This sort of mindset can be helpful for
        avoiding complacency, but it can also be detrimental to motivation when
        taken too far. In order to counteract this, it’s important to make a
        habit out of actively taking notice of what you <em>can</em> do in your
        target language. Even if you’re only understanding a word or two here
        and there, don’t take that for granted! When you’re consuming real,
        native Japanese, every word you understand is a big deal.
      </p>
      <h2 id="that-sounds-too-simple">
        That’s It? That Sounds Too Simple
      </h2>
      <p>
        The process unfolds in the following way. As you listen, you become able
        to parse the sounds more and more accurately. The more accurately you
        can parse the sounds, the more words will naturally pop out at you while
        listening. Because frequently used words will pop out so often, after
        looking them up once or twice, your memories of what they mean will be
        continually reinforced by more listening. You’ll also end up picking up
        many words from immersion alone, without ever looking them up.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you start understanding all the individual words being spoken, the
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_acquisition_device"
          target="_blank"
          >language acquisition device</a
        >
        in your brain will naturally fill in the blanks for you, and grammar
        will start to intuitively make sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this process, the amount you understand grows. As you get more
        comfortable with the language, it will become easier for you to remember
        new words. Thus, you’ll naturally become able to remember less
        frequently used words as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you did nothing other than continue this simple process of listening
        and occasionally looking things up, you would eventually become fluent
        in spoken Japanese. All the other steps of MIA, such as grammar study
        and using an SRS, simply play the role of accelerating this basic
        underlying process.
      </p>
      <h2 id="how-much">How Much Should I Immerse?</h2>
      <p>
        Only you can answer that question. What we can say is that the more you
        immerse each day, the faster you will improve. In fact, larger amounts
        of daily immersion lead to exponentially faster progress. Said another
        way, the more spread out your immersion is throughout time, the more
        total time it’s going to take. Check out
        <a href="https://youtu.be/7MxklQXJbz8" target="_blank">this video</a>
        by BritVsJapan to understand why this is.
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, we know you probably want some actual numbers, so here goes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DISCLAIMER</strong>:
        <em
          >The following should be considered extremely rough estimates at best.
          At the present moment, we do not have any reliable data on exactly how
          many hours of immersion it takes to reach fluency in Japanese. Also,
          one’s speed of progress is determined by many factors in addition to
          the total number of hours of active and passive immersion.</em
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        If you <em>don’t</em> already speak an Asian language and are learning
        Japanese, with around 5 hours per day of active and 5 hours per day of
        passive immersion, it should take around 2 years to reach fluency. With
        around 3 hours per day of active and 3 hours per day of passive
        immersion, it should take around 4 years to reach fluency.
      </p>
      <p>
        We would estimate that around 2 hours a day of active immersion is
        necessary to make real progress towards fluency. Because there aren’t
        any known examples of people reaching fluency in Japanese with around 1
        hour of immersion a day, it’s hard to say whether it’s possible or how
        long it would take. At the very least, with 1 hour of immersion a day,
        over time it should be possible to build up a basic foundation of
        comprehension ability in the language.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that out of the way, here are some other factors you may also want
        to take into account when deciding how much daily immersion you want to
        aim for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          What are your priorities? What in your life is more important than
          Japanese? What is less important? It goes without saying that no
          amount of Japanese ability would be worth sacrificing things like
          health, family, close friends, and other passions. On the other hand,
          some people may decide it’s worth putting aside some of their less
          important pastimes in order to spend more time with Japanese.
        </li>
        <li>
          The more Japanese you do each day, the faster you will improve. The
          faster you improve, the easier it will be to stay motivated. The more
          motivated you are, the more Japanese you will want to do each day.
          This can create a positive feedback loop that greatly aids the
          language learning process.
        </li>
        <li>
          Consistency is key to language learning success. So, we urge you to be
          careful not to bite off more than you can chew and risk burning out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Changing your entire life overnight is a near Herculean feat. Even if
          you plan on doing a hefty amount of immersion each day, it’s probably
          a good idea to start small and slowly ramp up over time. Building a
          consistent habit of 30 minutes of active immersion each day is a great
          place to start. It may also be useful to keep in mind that as your
          Japanese ability grows, immersion will progressively feel less like
          “language learning” and more like “enjoying content”. This will make
          it easier to spend more time with Japanese.
        </li>
        <li>
          By taking advantage of cracks of time in their day, even a fairly busy
          person may be able to rack up a solid number of passive immersion
          hours without making any significant changes to their lifestyle.
          Commuting, cooking, cleaning, exercising, and going to the bathroom
          are all potential opportunities for immersion. Check out the video
          below for some tools that might help you take advantage of these
          opportunities.

        Searching for new immersion content will get easier as the amount of
        Japanese you know grows. If you need somewhere to start, we recommend
        YouTube and Netflix.
      </p>
      <h3>YouTube</h3>
      <p>
        All in all, YouTube might be the single most valuable resource for a
        modern language learner. Not only is there a virtually infinite supply
        of potential Japanese immersion content, but you can also build
        playlists of all the interesting content you find for either re-watching
        or downloading later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some tips for finding immersion content on YouTube:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Switch your YouTube location to “Japan” and go to the “Trending” tab.
        </li>
        <li>
          Choose a topic you’re interested in, look up the Japanese equivalent
          on
          <a href="https://jisho.org/" target="_blank">jisho.org</a>, and search
          that into YouTube. Click around until you find something interesting.
        </li>
        <li>
          For recommended Japanese YouTube channels, google “Japanese YouTubers”
          in English.
        </li>
        <li>
          Find recommendations from other people doing MIA in the #media channel
          of the official MIA Discord Server, which you can join through

          (shameless plug!).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are many ways to easily download YouTube videos in bulk, such as
        JDownloader and youtube-dl. Google “how to download YouTube videos” to
        learn about how to use these tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        We highly recommend downloading YouTube videos and watching them
        offline. The reason for this is that it’s just too easy to get sucked
        into English YouTube when watching on the online platform. Another
        benefit of downloading and watching videos offline is that it enables
        you to easily extract the audio and put it on your immersion pod (as
        mentioned in a video linked earlier in this guide). You can find a video
        on how to do that
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yxVNj5KHzfI" target="_blank"
          >here</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h3 id="netflix">Netflix</h3>
      <p>
        Netflix is another great resource for finding Japanese immersion
        content. The nice thing about Netflix is that a lot of Japanese Netflix
        content comes with both Japanese and English subtitles. Quick google
        searches like “best anime on Netflix” or “best Japanese movies on
        Netflix” should allow you to find plenty of things to watch.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some more tips for getting the most out of Netflix:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Use a VPN to trick Netflix into thinking you’re in Japan and gain
          access to a much larger collection of Japanese media. Our recommended
          VPN is
          <a href="https://nordvpn.com/" target="_blank">Nord VPN</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the browser extension “Subadub” to make Netflix subtitles
          highlightable, so you can copy and paste text from them (<a
            href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/subadub/jamiekdimmhnnemaaimmdahnahfmfdfk"
            target="_blank"
            >Chrome link</a
          >,
          <a
            href="https://addons.mozilla.org/ja/firefox/addon/subadub/"
            target="_blank"
            >Firefox link</a
          >).
        </li>
        <li>
          Download content from Netflix using
          <a href="https://www.flixgrab.com/" target="_blank">this tool</a>.
          This allows you to extract audio for your immersion pod, as was talked
          about above. It also opens up the possibility of using Netflix with
          Subs2srs, which will be discussed in the
          <nuxt-link to="#sentence-mining" target="_blank"
            >sentence mining section</nuxt-link
          >.
        </li>
        <li>
          Watch shows with
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sttawmB2eAQ" target="_blank"
            >audio description tracks</a
          >.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1 id="srs">SRS</h1>
      <p>
        A spaced repetition system, or SRS, generally refers to smart flashcard
        software that uses a scheduling algorithm to optimize study.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to understand why SRS’s are so powerful, let’s start by
        comparing them to the alternative: paper flashcards. The problem with
        paper flashcards is that you don’t really know when to review which
        cards. Reviewing things you already know well is a waste of time. On the
        other hand, if you don’t review things before you forget them, you end
        up having to waste time on re-learning. This might not really be a
        problem if you’re just trying to pass a test. But, if you’re actually
        trying to retain a large body of knowledge long term, you’re going to
        need a more advanced tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        The scheduling algorithm found in SRS’s solve this problem. Using an
        algorithm based on human memory, combined with feedback that you give
        it, an SRS is able to predict the ideal time for you to study each
        flashcard you put into the system. Based on these predictions, you’re
        automatically shown what specific cards to study each day. This allows
        you to continue to retain knowledge with minimal time wasted on
        unnecessary reviews and re-learning things you forgot. Used correctly
        over the long term, an SRS can allow you to commit tens of thousands of
        items to memory with only minutes of reviewing each day.
      </p>
      <h2>Which SRS Should I Use?</h2>
      <p>
        There are currently many different SRS’s available. But, in our opinion,
        there are only two really worth taking seriously: Anki and SuperMemo.
      </p>
      <p>
        SuperMemo was the first SRS ever invented, and it has continued to
        receive upgrades since its original release in 1985. It has by far the
        most advanced algorithm and the largest number of features. The problem
        is that it’s extremely quirky and difficult to use. It’s also only
        available for Windows (meaning it can’t be used online, on a Mac, or on
        a smartphone).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why we recommend Anki. Anki is a versatile SRS with a large
        selection of features. The
        <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">desktop version</a>
        is available for Windows, Mac and Linux, there’s a fully
        <a href="https://ankiweb.net/" target="_blank">online version</a>, and
        there are smartphone apps for both
        <a
          href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387"
          >iOS</a
        >
        and
        <a
          href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&amp;hl=en_US"
          target="_blank"
          >Android</a
        >. You can create an account and sync your collection freely between
        each of these platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        All versions of Anki are 100% free, with the exception of the iOS app,
        which costs 25 USD. The creator of Anki chooses to only charge money for
        the iOS app in order to keep the desktop version free (the Android app
        was created by a third party). If you’re an Apple user and planning on
        using Anki, the app will likely be well worth the cost in the long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        The great thing about Anki is that it allows you to install user-created
        add-ons to add custom features. There are many add-ons available that
        greatly aid Japanese study, including a few MIA originals. For a
        language learner, these add-ons are really what seals the deal for
        choosing Anki. You can find a list of public add-ons
        <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/addons/2.1" target="_blank">here</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another useful feature is that Anki allows users to easily import and
        export flashcard decks. This means you can easily share your decks with
        others, as well as benefit from decks others have made. MIA original
        Anki decks will be linked later in this guide. You can also find a
        public database of pre-made Anki decks
        <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/" target="_blank">here</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Getting Started With Anki</h2>
      <p>
        We said above that SuperMemo is quirky and difficult to use, but Anki
        isn’t exactly the easiest to use either. There’s a bit of a learning
        curve, so try to stick with it, even if it feels frustrating at times.
        It gets better, we promise. Anki has a lot of features, but don’t worry
        about figuring them all out at once. Just pick things up slowly as you
        go along.
      </p>
      <p>
        The
        <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/docs/manual.html" target="_blank"
          >official Anki User Manual</a
        >
        is the most comprehensive explanation of how Anki works. Matt has also
        created a more user-friendly explanation of some crucial functions of
        the program, which you can find
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lz60qTP2Gx0" target="_blank"
          >here</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a quick YouTube search, you can find many Anki tutorials aimed at
        newcomers. Most of these will be aimed at either medical school students
        or language learners. Unfortunately, the ones aimed at med students tend
        to contain a lot of irrelevant information (if you’re not a med
        student), and the ones aimed at language learners tend to contain a lot
        of bad language learning advice. There is still a lot you can learn from
        these videos, but don’t take any of the specific advice seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        In MIA, the SRS is used for a few different purposes, such as learning
        kana and kanji, learning grammar and vocab, and learning cultural
        knowledge such as famous people and places. The following sections in
        the guide will go into the specific details of exactly how to use Anki
        for each of these purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The last thing we’ll mention here is that, by default, the way Anki’s
        algorithm works actually isn’t very ideal for language learning. This
        can be fixed with a modification to Anki known as “<a
          href="/table-of-contents/anki/low-key-anki/intro/"
          target="_blank"
          >Low-Key Anki</a
        >“, which consists of 3 add-ons. Unfortunately, there is quite a bit of
        background knowledge needed in order to understand the problems with the
        default Anki algorithm, and why Low-key Anki remedies these problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you begin feeling comfortable with Anki, we recommend reading our
        article series on Low-Key Anki and implementing the modification. Until
        then, you can greatly improve the functioning of Anki’s algorithm simply
        by
        <strong>never using the “hard” button</strong>. When grading cards,
        stick to only “again” and “good”. If you combine this simple principle
        with the specific option-group settings we’ll provide in each of the
        following sections, you should be able to get great mileage out of
        Anki’s algorithm.
      </p>
      <h2>Warning!</h2>
      <p>
        In order for SRS’s like Anki to really work well, it’s crucial to
        consistently keep up with daily reviews. Every day, Anki will show you
        the cards it thinks you’re likely to soon forget. So naturally, not
        reviewing these cards will lead to increased forgetting. Additionally,
        skipping a day’s reviews also means signing up for double the reviews
        the next day. Because of this, catching up on reviews once you’ve fallen
        behind can be quite a headache. Of course, missing a day every now and
        again isn’t going to be detrimental, but this is only if it’s
        <em>actually</em> every now and again.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a related note, be extremely careful about learning too many new
        cards. The more new cards you learn a day, the more daily reviews you’re
        going to have. The thing is, there’s a time delay between when you start
        learning more new cards and when your reviews start to skyrocket. If you
        try something crazy like learning 100 new cards a day, things might seem
        fine for a few days. But within a week or two, you’ll end up with
        hundreds upon hundreds of reviews a day. You can use this
        <a href="https://pheartheceal.github.io/anki-optimizer/" target="_blank"
          >Anki simulator</a
        >
        to experiment with the relationship between number of new cards and
        reviews.
      </p>
      <h1 id="kana">Kana</h1>
      <p>
        After you’ve started immersing and have Anki installed, if you haven’t
        already, the next thing you will want to do is learn kana, AKA, hiragana
        and katakana.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you already have a good grasp of hiragana and katakana, you can skip
        this section. If you’re entirely new to the Japanese writing system,
        check out
        <a href="https://youtu.be/CFq2Y43DY0U" target="_blank">this video</a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <p>
        There are a plethora of different resources available for learning kana.
        Some provide mnemonics, and others assist you in drilling them in
        through brute force. Which resource will be best for you is largely a
        matter of personal preference. Our recommendation is to click through
        the resources listed below and see what catches your attention. Feel
        free to mix and match resources in whatever way feels useful.

      <p>
        <strong>WARNING</strong>: The resources above contain what MIA considers
        to be ineffective language learning advice. We recommend using them to
        learn kana but disregarding the language learning advice they provide.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s probably a good idea to practice writing out the kana with a pen
        and paper, in order to build some physical muscle memory related to the
        characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        With a small amount of daily practice, within a week or two, you should
        be able to get fairly familiar with kana. Once you can read and write
        out all of the hiragana and katakana characters with relative ease,
        you’re ready to move on to Recognition RTK.
      </p>
      <h2>Anki</h2>
      <p>
        Although it’s probably not necessary, you can also combine any of the
        resources above with Anki.
        <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/kana" target="_blank">Here</a>
        is&nbsp;a link to various Anki decks for hiragana and katakana. On that
        page, you can even find Anki decks created specifically to be used
        alongside some of the resources listed above.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you’re going to use Anki for learning kana, here are our recommended
        option-group settings:

      <h2>A Three-Part Approach to Kanji</h2>
      <p>
        Just because you can recognize something, that doesn’t necessarily mean
        you can recall it from memory. For example, in English, sometimes you’re
        able to read a word, but not spell it. As you can see with this example,
        in general,
        <em>recognition</em> is much easier than
        <em>production<em>. </em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why, initially, we think it’s best to only worry about learning
        to
        <em>recognize</em> kanji characters. Using the right system and tools,
        this can be done easily and fairly quickly. And once you can recognize
        kanji, you can learn to read written Japanese without too much trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning to read Japanese will naturally lead you to become extremely
        familiar with kanji. That being said, since reading only requires
        character <em>recognition</em> (and not production), learning to read
        won’t automatically enable you to recall characters from memory. But, it
        will take you most of the way there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let’s go back to spelling English for a moment. Think about those times
        when you can’t remember the spelling of a familiar word. Usually, you
        can see it in your mind’s eye, but just can’t quite recall it. Once you
        write out a few possibilities, you can intuitively tell which spelling
        is correct. This is how learning to produce kanji from memory will feel
        like after becoming able to read Japanese. And once you reach this
        point, with just a little practice, cultivating the ability to recall
        characters from memory will come very quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, trying to learn to recall characters from memory
        before you actually know Japanese is extremely difficult. It can be
        done, but it’s almost certainly not worth the time and effort. This is
        why we recommend a three-part approach to learning kanji: 1) learn to
        <em>recognize</em> kanji, 2) learn to read Japanese, and 3) learn to
        <em>produce</em> kanji. This way, you can reach a point of kanji mastery
        without any serious pain or struggle.
      </p>
      <h2>Kanji Production is Overrated</h2>
      <p>
        When we say “kanji production<em>“</em> or “the ability to recall kanji
        from memory”, we’re referring to the ability to write out kanji
        characters by hand. This isn’t needed to be able to
        <em>type</em> Japanese because Japanese typing is done phonetically. So,
        as long as you can read kanji, you can type kanji as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        The ability to produce kanji from memory isn’t nearly as important as it
        used to be, since nowadays nearly all writing is done on a keyboard. As
        a result of this, even Japanese native speakers have been getting worse
        at writing out kanji from memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why we think it’s completely fine to put off learning to produce
        kanji from memory until after a high level of reading comprehension has
        been acquired. Some learners may choose to never learn how to write out
        kanji by hand, and we think that’s perfectly reasonable as well.
      </p>
      <h2>Kanji Recognition Explained</h2>
      <p>
        Before you start studying Japanese, most kanji aren’t going to look like
        much more than a blob of random scribbles. Of course, some of the more
        pictograph-like&nbsp;characters, like&nbsp;山&nbsp;(mountain)
        or&nbsp;木&nbsp;(tree), are simple and straight forward to
        remember.&nbsp;But,&nbsp;these only represent a tiny fraction of all the
        characters you need to know to be proficient in Japanese.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing is, nearly all kanji are made up of different combinations of
        the same basic ~200 components. The key to learning kanji is training
        your brain to see them in terms of these components. This way, seemingly
        complicated characters like “露” can be seen as simply
        <em>rain</em> (雨) +&nbsp;<em>path</em>&nbsp;(路)&nbsp;=&nbsp;<em
          >dew</em
        >
        (露). Now, why does <em>rain </em>+ <em>path</em> = <em>dew</em>? Who
        knows; kanji etymology is unclear in more cases than not. Regardless,
        remembering that <em>rain</em> and <em>path</em>&nbsp;combine to
        make&nbsp;<em>dew</em> is a lot easier than remembering a blob of random
        scribbles.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you get more comfortable with seeing kanji in terms of their
        components, learning new kanji will become easier and easier.
        Eventually, you’ll reach the point we call being
        <em>fluent in the meta-language of&nbsp;kanji</em>. Once you reach
        this&nbsp;point, your brain actually stops seeing characters in terms of
        their component parts, and instead starts to see each kanji as a unified
        whole. This is actually how your brain handles words in English as well.
        The reason you’re able to read this text as fast as you are is that your
        brain is able to recognize entire words at once, without needing to pay
        attention to individual letters. That’s why it’s possible to read texts
        such as this:
      </p>
      <blockquote class="bq">
        <p>
          “Aoccdrnig to rscheearch at Cmabrigde Uinervtisy, it deosn’t mttaer in
          waht oredr the ltteers in a wrod are, the olny iprmoetnt tihng is taht
          the frist and lsat ltteer be at the rghit pclae. The rset can be a
          toatl mses and you can sitll raed it wouthit a porbelm. Tihs is
          bcuseae the huamn mnid deos not raed ervey lteter by istlef, but the
          wrod as a wlohe.” (<a
            href="http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt-davis/cmabridge/"
            target="_blank"
            >source</a
          >)
        </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In other words, your brain will become able to treat kanji this way.
        Once this happens, recognizing the appearance of a kanji
        will&nbsp;become&nbsp;just&nbsp;like recognizing the face of a
        person.&nbsp;After spending just a few seconds looking at someone for
        the first time, you instantly remember their face. You could go years
        without seeing that person again, and if shown a picture&nbsp;of
        them,&nbsp;their face would likely still feel familiar. You might not
        remember who they are or how you know them,
        but&nbsp;you&nbsp;would&nbsp;know that you’ve seen them somewhere
        before.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, think about the way you remember a face. Do you memorize the exact
        distance between the person’s eyes and categorize the shape of their
        nose? Of course not. Their face simply has a “look”, and you instantly
        and automatically remember it. Remembering new characters will become
        just like this. As soon as you see a new character, it will look like
        <em>something</em>. When you see that character again, you will
        instantly recognize&nbsp;it as&nbsp;the same character.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, that being said, this doesn’t necessarily mean that you know what
        the character means or how it’s read. It also doesn’t mean that you can
        write out the character from memory. It simply means that when you see
        the character, you instantly know that it’s
        <em>that</em> character. This is what we mean by “the ability to
        recognize kanji”.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might not&nbsp;seem like much, but in reality, this ability is a
        superpower in the context of learning Japanese. Learning to read and
        understand a word containing a new kanji becomes as simple as, well,
        remembering how it’s read and what it means. You won’t have to deal with
        the additional obstacle of trying to force a blob of random scribbles
        into your memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        And like we explained above, it’s through learning to read and
        understand words that you’ll be able to naturally build an extensive
        mental database of exactly how specific individual characters are read
        and used in different contexts.
      </p>
      <h2>Learning to Recognize the Kanji</h2>
      <p>
        Our recommended method of training kanji recognition is Recognition RTK,
        a modified version of <em>Remembering the Kanji</em> (RTK) combined with
        an SRS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, James Heisig wrote the book
        <em>Remembering the Kanji</em> to help Japanese newcomers become able to
        both recognize and produce the ~3,000 most common kanji. To do this, he
        employed a number of innovative ideas, such as ordering characters based
        on their components (instead of frequency), creating story-based
        mnemonics using those components, and introducing only a single basic
        meaning of each kanji (initially ignoring readings and alternate
        meanings). If you’re interested in learning more about the logic behind
        RTK, check out the extensive intro at the beginning of the RTK part 1
        book.
      </p>
      <p>
        RTK does open up the possibility of learning to both recognize and
        produce kanji as a pure beginner. But, as we explained above, this is
        far more trouble than it’s worth. Indeed, most of the people who attempt
        RTK in its original form give up before making it to the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Enter Recognition RTK (hereafter “RRTK”). RRTK is an SRS-based
        modification to the original RTK intended to optimize it for training
        recognition. RRTK preserves RTK’s innovative component-based sequencing
        of kanji and story-based mnemonic system. Where it differs is that RRTK
        flashcards have a kanji on the <em>front</em> and the meaning of the
        kanji on the <em>back</em>. While reviewing each card, the goal is to
        <em>recognize</em> the kanji on the front and recall its basic meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        RRTK also only covers the most frequently used 1,000 kanji. The reason
        for this is that the main goal of RRTK is <em>not</em> to learn what
        every kanji means, but simply to bring learners to the point where
        recognizing a kanji feels similar to recognizing a human face. As soon
        as you reach this point, rather than continuing to study isolated kanji,
        you’re going to be better off jumping into real Japanese and picking up
        more kanji as you go. The idea is that 1,000 kanji should be more than
        enough to take you to this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although the main goal of RRTK is to train kanji recognition ability, a
        secondary goal is to help you learn the general meaning of kanji as
        well. This is why RRTK covers the <em>most frequently used</em> kanji,
        instead of simply the first 1,000 kanji in the original RTK book (recall
        that RTK orders kanji based on their components, not their frequency).
        The most frequently used 1,000 kanji comprise more than 90% of all kanji
        used in written Japanese. So, knowing the basic meaning of all of these
        kanji will be hugely beneficial when diving into real Japanese.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE</strong>: Previously, MIA referred to “Recognition RTK” as
        “Lazy Kanji”. “Lazy Kanji” is a term that Khatzumoto from AJATT used to
        refer to his own modified version of RTK, which was similar, although
        significantly different, from RRTK. In order to avoid confusion, we
        decided to change the name to the more straightforward and objectively
        accurate “Recognition RTK”.

      <h3>
        1,250 Cards for 1,000 Kanji
      </h3>

      <p>
        Like we mentioned earlier, one of RTK’s most powerful innovations was
        sequencing characters based on their components, such that each
        character learned can be viewed as a simple combination of familiar
        elements. RRTK makes use of this methodical sequencing to help users
        learn to recognize the most common 1,000 kanji. That said, applying
        RTK’s original sequencing to RRTK wasn’t as straightforward as trimming
        RTK’s kanji list down to the most common characters.
      </p>

      <p>
        Within the original RTK book, components of kanji are referred to as
        “primitive elements”. Please note that RTK’s primitive elements do not
        align with traditional kanji
        <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_kanji_radicals_by_frequency"
          target="_blank"
          >radicals</a
        >. To go back to the example from above, RTK breaks down the character
        “露” (dew) into the primitive elements “雨” (rain) and “路” (path). In
        this case, both primitive elements also exist as independent kanji.
        However, there are also primitive elements that do not exist as
        independent kanji, and are solely used as components of other
        characters. For example, the primitive element "宀" is used inside many
        kanji (for example, "家" (house)), but isn't actually a kanji itself.
      </p>

      <p>
        Oftentimes, common kanji are composed of fairly uncommon component
        characters. For example, the extremely common kanji “頭” (head) contains
        within it the kanji “頁” (page), which is rarely used. Because of this,
        reducing RTK to strictly the most common 1,000 characters would be quite
        problematic. Uncommon kanji that function as primitive elements would
        end up getting removed, which would in turn make learning characters
        that contain those primitive elements much more difficult.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to remedy this, in addition to the 1,000 most common kanji, the
        RRTK deck also contains cards for an additional 250 primitive elements.
        Some of these primitive elements exist as independent kanji, while
        others are used exclusively as components of other characters. Although
        these primitive elements are not actually common kanji themselves,
        because they’re also <em>components</em> of common kanji, learning them
        is necessary in order to fully benefit from RTK’s original mnemonic
        system.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Card Format
      </h3>

      <p>
        The deck consists of 3 different types of cards: kanji cards, primitive
        element cards, and instruction cards. Kanji cards are for kanji,
        primitive element cards are for primitive elements that are not
        themselves independent kanji, and instruction cards provide information
        about either the deck itself or kanji in general.
      </p>

          width="687"
          height="449"
        />
      </p>

      <p>
        On the front of each card, you’ll find a kanji or primitive element
        written in 4 different fonts. The reason for having multiple fonts is
        that, depending on the character, the same kanji can look quite
        different depending on the font. So, the more you’re exposed to
        different fonts, the more prepared you’ll be.
      </p>

      <p>
        The RTK number for each kanji is listed at the top of every kanji card.
        If you click this number, it functions as a hyperlink that will take you
        to the kanji’s entry on
        <a href="http://hochanh.github.io/rtk/" target="_blank">this site</a>.
        Please note that the numbers listed here correspond with the kanji’s
        position within the 2,200 characters presented in the original RTK book,
        not the kanji’s position within RRTK. On primitive element cards,
        “Primitive Element” is listed in place of an RTK number.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the back of kanji cards, you’ll find the original RTK keyword, some
        other meanings of the kanji, the top two highest-rated mnemonic stories
        from the
        <a href="https://kanji.koohii.com/" target="_blank"
          >Kanji Koohii website</a
        >, and any “primitive element meanings” listed for that kanji in the
        original RTK book. A “primitive element meaning” is a meaning a
        character takes on when used as a component of another kanji. For
        example, when the kanji for "one" (一) is used as a primitive element
        (for example, in "下" (below)), it can take on the meaning of "ceiling".
        To help you tell them apart, primitive element meanings are listed in a
        red font.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the back of primitive element cards, an explanation of that
        primitive’s meaning is all that is listed. As with “primitive element
        meanings” on kanji cards, the explanations on primitive element cards
        appear in a red font.
      </p>
      <p>
        The deck also comes pre-set with recommended option-group settings. The
        only one you need to worry about changing is “New cards/day” in the “New
        Cards” tab. Adjust this at any time to reflect how many new kanji you
        want to learn each day.
      </p>

      <h2>How to Use</h2>

      <h3>How do I learn new kanji?</h3>

      <p>
        In order to learn a new kanji, break it down into its component
        primitive elements and come up with a story to link those elements to
        the kanji’s meaning. If one of the stories on the back of the card makes
        sense, go with that. If neither of the stories on the back resonate, you
        can either tweak one of them or come up with something completely new.
        If you need some inspiration, you can check out other people’s stories
        on the
        <a href="https://kanji.koohii.com/">Kanji Koohii website</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Feel free to take some liberties when tinkering with the meaning of
        primitive elements and modifying stories. The mnemonics are just a
        pragmatic tool for remembering the characters, so whatever works is
        fine.
      </p>

      <h3>How many new cards a day?</h3>
      <p>
        Depending on how much time you currently have available, we recommend
        learning between 10 and 30 new kanji a day. At a rate of 10 a day, you
        can finish in a little over 3 months. With 30 a day, you can finish in a
        little over 1 month.
      </p>
      <p>
        During RRTK, we recommend allocating around 50% to 75% of your “active”
        time learning and reviewing kanji. Leave around 25%~50% for immersion.
        Also, no matter how much time you have available each day, we don’t
        recommend spending more than 2 hours a day on kanji study.
      </p>
      <h3>How should I grade cards?</h3>
      <p>
        If you could recall the general meaning of the character with relative
        ease, grade the card “good”. If you couldn’t recall the general meaning
        of the character, or you could recall the general meaning but it took
        quite a bit of time/effort, then mark the card “again”. If the character
        has multiple meanings, as long as you could recall at least
        <em>one</em> of those meanings, that’s good enough. Don’t worry about
        recalling the exact RTK keyword. For example, the keyword for “町” is
        “village”. If you were able to recall anything like “town” or “city”,
        that’s good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you didn’t need to use a mnemonic to recall the meaning of a kanji,
        that’s fine. There’s no need to force yourself to recall a mnemonic. If
        you did need to use a mnemonic to recall the meaning of a kanji, that’s
        completely fine too. Whether or not you used a mnemonic to recall the
        kanji shouldn’t affect the grade you give a card.
      </p>
      <h3>Should I write out the kanji?</h3>
      <p>
        It’s a good idea to write out new characters when you initially learn
        them, but we don’t recommend writing out kanji while doing your Anki
        reviews. Because you’re really only after recognition, it’s not going to
        be worth the extra time and effort.
      </p>
      <h3>What should I do about leeches?</h3>
      <p>
        In Anki, a “lapse” is when a learned card is graded “again”. When the
        same card lapses 5 times, Anki will mark it a “leech” and suspend the
        card. Leeches are a natural part of the learning process. Some things
        you learn will stick easily, some won’t stick no matter what you try,
        and most stuff will be somewhere in between. For those small minority of
        cards that just won’t stick, AKA leeches, it’s best to just get rid of
        them. Instead of wasting a bunch of time on a single leech, it’s more
        productive to learn 5 normal cards in its place.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may seem counter-intuitive to delete a kanji out of your deck, but in
        reality, it’s really not a big deal. If you end up knowing 950 of the
        1,000 most frequently used kanji, that’s more than enough to move onto
        the next stage of the learning process. You’ll pick up those missing 50,
        along with thousands of other kanji, naturally as you continue to
        immerse yourself in Japanese. No one word or kanji is going to make or
        break you, and it’s never too late to learn something later.
      </p>
      <h3>
        I finished my Anki reviews for the day but still have time. Should I
        review extra?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We strongly advise against doing so. Anki will tell you exactly how much
        you should review. Reviewing more than this can actually hurt the
        effectiveness of Anki’s algorithm. If you have extra time after
        finishing your kanji work for the day, do more active immersion.
      </p>
      <h3>When should I delete my Recognition RTK deck?</h3>
      <p>
        If you delete your RRTK deck immediately after completing Recognition
        RTK, you’ll likely end up quickly forgetting a significant portion of
        the kanji you learned. In order to avoid this, it’s important to
        continue reviewing your Anki deck after completing RRTK. That said, even
        if you continue diligently keeping up with your daily reviews, after a
        few months after completing RRTK, the retention rate of your deck will
        likely start to decline. This is an inevitable outcome of not
        emphasizing mnemonics while learning the characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, this shouldn’t be much of a problem. By the time this starts to
        happen, you should have a strong enough footing in reading immersion
        (watching with Japanese subtitles) to retain the core of your kanji
        ability through immersion alone. Yes, you may forget what a specific
        kanji means here and there, but what’s really important is the ability
        to identify characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        As long as you have a strong footing in reading immersion, it’s fine to
        delete your RRTK deck once the retention rate starts to decline. To be
        specific, we recommend continuing to review your RRTK deck for 3~6
        months after completing Recognition RTK. After that, you can delete your
        deck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another option is to use the
        <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/1666520655"
          >MIA Retirement add-on</a
        >
        to set a retiring interval for your RRTK deck. If you take this
        approach, we recommend setting a 9-month retiring interval.

      <h2>How Will I Learn Kanji Readings?</h2>
      <p>
        The most pragmatic way of going about learning to read kanji is to
        forget the whole idea that kanji have individual “readings”.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reality, the only time you’ll ever need to know how a kanji is read
        is in the context of reading a word. So, as long as you can read words,
        your kanji reading problem is solved. And like we mentioned above, once
        you have a basic ability to identify characters, you can jump right into
        learning words (exactly how to go about learning words will be discussed
        in later sections).
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you’ve learned to read a few hundred words, you’ll naturally start
        gaining an intuition for how specific characters tend to be read in
        different contexts. Eventually, you’ll find that you can guess the
        readings of new words with high levels of accuracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a more in-depth explanation of why you shouldn’t worry about kanji
        readings, watch from 1:53 to 10:55 of
        <a href="https://youtu.be/TgRte6oSoF8?t=113">this video</a>
        (note: Matt has updated his views on some of the conclusions reached in
        this video, as reflected in this guide).
      </p>
      <h1 id="grammar">Basic Grammar</h1>
      <p>
        Once you’ve learned kana and completed Recognition RTK, you’re ready to
        start studying the language formally. In MIA, this takes the form of
        <em>basic grammar</em> and <em>basic vocab</em>.
      </p>
      <h2>The Role of Grammar Study</h2>
      <p>
        In MIA, the goal of studying grammar is strictly to increase the
        comprehensibility of your immersion. In other words, learning the basics
        of Japanese grammar will vastly improve your ability to understand and
        learn from real Japanese, and to this extent, grammar study is
        worthwhile.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, most language courses (including some of those linked
        below) teach grammar with the intention of helping learners become able
        to
        <em>output</em>, AKA speak and write, their target language.
        Unfortunately, this doesn’t really work. Because
        <nuxt-link
          to="/table-of-contents/stage-1/theory/acquisition-vs-learning/"
          >learned knowledge is largely separate from acquired
          ability</nuxt-link
        >
        and
        <a href="https://youtu.be/y8JK8W8dBxk">language isn’t math</a>,
        conscious grammar study is <em>not</em> an effective way of becoming
        able to speak and write a foreign language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Output ability is the result of subconscious
        <em>acquisition</em>, and this acquisition happens by comprehending
        <em>input</em>, AKA, speech and text, in your target language (this is
        known as the
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis"
          >input hypothesis</a
        >). So, grammar study is useful to the extent that it helps us
        comprehend target language input, but not useful for actually speaking
        and writing the language.
      </p>
      <h2>Theory vs. Practice</h2>
      <p>
        The idea of theory vs. practice is very relevant to the topic of grammar
        study. The following video explains the basic idea:
      </p>

      <YouTubeEmbed src="https://youtube.com/embed/UHAa0mFOsYM" />

      <p>
        In the context of grammar, “theory” refers to “conscious grammar
        knowledge gained through study”, and “practice” refers to “intuitive
        grammar understanding acquired through input”.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, there’s a hard limit to how deeply it’s possible to
        understand Japanese grammar without actually acquiring a certain amount
        of Japanese. You could memorize an entire encyclopedia’s worth of
        Japanese grammar theory, but without an ample amount of immersion, that
        knowledge isn’t going to be very useful to you. You will be like someone
        who has read 10 books on how to swim but has never been in a pool.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, as we explained above, a certain amount of grammar theory
        will be useful in guiding your practice. But, after a certain point, any
        additional grammar study you do will have greatly diminishing returns.
        The reason for this is that you can’t <em>really</em> begin to
        understand how Japanese grammar actually works until you’ve spent many
        hours exposing yourself to how grammar actually plays out in real
        Japanese.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of this, when approaching basic grammar, try to make
        <em>quick and dirty</em> your motto. If something’s just not clicking,
        leave it and move on. If something feels unimportant, leave it and move
        on. It’s never too late to revisit something later. Plus, even if you
        don’t, eventually immersion will make everything clear. Like Matt
        explained in the video above, as long as you stick with it, eventually,
        practice will solve all your problems. As evidence for this, you didn’t
        need to study grammar to acquire your native language.
      </p>
      <h2>Resources</h2>
      <p>
        There are many different Japanese grammar resources out there, and
        really, it doesn’t matter which one you use. After all, you’re just
        looking for some
        <em>quick and dirty</em> knowledge anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, we recommend
        <a href="http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar"
          >Tae Kim’s Japanese Grammar Guide</a
        >. It’s what Matt used, and it worked well for him. It breaks down
        Japanese in a logical and straight forward way and covers all the basics
        without going into too much detail.
      </p>
      <p>
        If for whatever reason Tae Kim’s guide just really doesn’t sit well with
        you, some other resources you might check out are
        <a href="https://www.imabi.net/tableofcontents.htm"
          >IMABI’S Japanese Grammar Guide</a
        >
        (thorough and detailed) or
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOcym2c7xnBwU12Flkm5RcLIEhvURQ8TB"
          >Japanese from Zero</a
        >
        (extremely user-friendly).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>WARNING</strong>: The resources above may contain what MIA
        considers to be ineffective language learning advice. We recommend
        making use of their grammar explanations but disregarding their language
        learning advice.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Use</h2>
      <p>
        If you go with Tae Kim, we recommend reading through the basic grammar,
        Essential Grammar, Special Expressions, and Advanced Topics sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t try to memorize anything; just read through, and see what sticks.
        Keep in mind that the goal of grammar study is to increase
        comprehension. This means you don’t need to worry about things like all
        the different types of verbs and exactly how they conjugate. As long as
        you can recognize the different forms when you see them, that’s all you
        need. For example, as long as you can recognize when a verb is in the
        te-form, then you can understand it. The rules for how to conjugate
        verbs into the te-form aren’t necessary. Once you’ve gotten enough
        immersion, you’ll become able to conjugate into the te-form intuitively.
      </p>
      <h3>Should I make Anki cards?</h3>
      <p>
        You can, but we don’t recommend it. Like we said above, when it comes to
        grammar, some stuff will click, and other stuff won’t. If you’re
        regularly immersing, you won’t need Anki to remember the stuff that
        clicks. And if something’s just not making sense, creating Anki cards
        for it is just going to be frustrating.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you were going to make Anki cards for Tae Kim, the best way to go
        about doing so would be to make sentence cards out of the example
        sentences. A sentence card is an SRS card with an example sentence on
        the front, and whatever is needed to understand the sentence on the
        back. When reviewing the card, your job is simply to read and understand
        the sentence. Sentence cards will be explained in-depth later on in the
        guide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Making sentence cards out of Tae Kim’s example sentences would help you
        consolidate grammar and vocabulary at the same time. The problem is that
        many of Tae Kim’s example sentences introduce multiple new words at the
        same time. Sentence cards that contain more than one new word are
        generally very difficult and frustrating to learn. Because of this, we
        recommend a different way of using the SRS to consolidate basic grammar
        and vocab, which will be discussed in the next section.
      </p>
      <h3>
        How much time should I spend studying basic grammar each day?
      </h3>
      <p>
        It’s up to you, but we would recommend around 15 minutes. We all know
        that reading about grammar isn’t exactly the most exciting thing in the
        world. Plus, consuming grammar theory incrementally over time will make
        it easier to consolidate and integrate.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you take the approach of only spending ~15 minutes a day studying
        grammar, it’s completely fine to do basic grammar alongside Recognition
        RTK and/or basic vocab (which will be discussed in the next section).
      </p>
      <h1 id="vocab">Basic Vocab</h1>
      <p>
        In Japanese, the most frequently used 1,000 words comprise around 75% of
        all spoken and written language (<a
          href="https://pj.ninjal.ac.jp/corpus_center/bccwj/freq-list.html"
          >source</a
        >). Similar statistics are true for every human language. Because of
        this, memorizing the most frequently used 1,000 words is a great way to
        jumpstart your comprehension when beginning to learn a new language. In
        MIA, this is referred to as
        <em>basic vocab<em>. </em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Naturally, the SRS is the perfect tool for this task. The question then
        becomes, what kind of SRS cards should be used? Our recommendation is
        sentence cards. As mentioned in the previous section, a sentence card
        has an example sentence on the front, and whatever is needed to
        understand the sentence on the back. When reviewing the card, your job
        is simply to read and understand the sentence. Sentence cards will be
        discussed in-depth in the next section. If you have a question related
        to basic vocab that isn’t answered in this section, some of them may be
        answered there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although sentence cards are the ideal way to use an SRS to learn vocab,
        in practice, this can be difficult to do as a beginner. The thing is, in
        order for sentence cards to be effective, it’s important that each card
        only introduces a single unknown word. But, for a beginner who doesn’t
        know many words, finding these kinds of sentences is going to be near
        impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually, this leaves you with two options for getting past the basic
        vocab stage. Either you can learn sentences with multiple unknown words
        in them, or you can make isolated vocab cards (which will be discussed
        in the next section). Neither option is ideal, but isolated vocab cards
        are the better of the two. The reason for this is that sentence cards
        with multiple unknown words are usually extremely difficult and
        frustrating to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, in the case of Japanese, there’s a resource available that makes it
        possible to easily learn vocab through sentences right from the start.
      </p>
      <h2>JLPT Tango N5</h2>
      <p>
        The book <em>1000 Essential Vocabulary for the JLPT N5</em>, also known
        as <em>JLPT Tango N5</em>, contains ~1,000 Japanese sentences and their
        English translations. As you can probably tell by its title, the book
        was designed with the Japanese Language Proficiency Test in mind. But,
        this is entirely irrelevant for our purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason we’re interested in the JLPT Tango N5 is that the sentences
        are ordered in such a way that each sentence only introduces a single
        new word or grammar pattern. It’s designed to teach intuitively through
        example sentences and keeps technical explanations of grammar and
        vocabulary to a minimum. This makes it ideal for our purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
        What’s even better is that you can download audio files of native audio
        for all of the sentences in the book on the
        <a
          href="https://www.ask-books.com/jp/hajimete-jlpt/hajimete-jlpt-audio/"
          >publisher’s website</a
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some downsides of the book are that the vocabulary taught doesn’t align
        precisely with Japanese frequency lists, some of the sentences are
        contrived, and all the sentences are in polite forms. But, despite these
        downsides, JLPT Tango N5 is currently the best resource available for
        our purpose, and will definitely get the job done.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can purchase the book on
        <a
          href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%81%AF%E3%81%98%E3%82%81%E3%81%A6%E3%81%AE%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%AC%E8%AA%9E%E8%83%BD%E5%8A%9B%E8%A9%A6%E9%A8%93-N5%E5%8D%98%E8%AA%9E1000-Hajimete-Nouryoku-Vietnamese/dp/4872179811/?language=en_US"

      <h2>Tango N5 Anki Deck</h2>
      <p>
        With the help of some of our patrons, we have created an Anki deck
        specifically for the JLPT Tango N5. Because the deck is based on a book,
        we are unable to provide a public link to access the deck. If you would
        like the deck, please submit the
        <a href="https://forms.gle/hzGpFbjNwWqPLRU29">N5 deck request form</a>
        and we will reply with a download link. Either a picture of you with the
        book or with the receipt can serve as proof of purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img
          src="https://massimmersionapproach.com/imgs/2019/09/BSC.gif"
          alt=""
          width="800"
          height="450"
        />
      </p>
      <p>
        The deck has cards formatted as text-based bilingual sentence cards by
        default (sentence on the front; reading, translation, word meanings, and
        audio on the back). Each card also comes with a “reverse” field that,
        when filled, turns the card into an audio-based sentence card (audio on
        the front; reading, translation, and word meanings on the back).
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the JLPT Tango N5 was created as a JLPT prep book, it only uses
        kanji that are tested on the JLPT N5. This means that lots of words that
        are usually written in kanji in real life show up written with kana in
        the book. Because this deck was designed for people who have already
        completed Recognition RTK, all of these words have been converted to
        kanji.
      </p>
      <p>
        The deck also comes pre-set with recommended option-group settings. The
        only one you need to worry about changing is “New cards/day” in the “New
        Cards” tab. Adjust this at any time to reflect how many new cards you
        want to learn each day.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Use</h2>
      <p>
        Because the Tango N5 deck is a deck of sentence cards, most of the
        instructions for how to use the deck will be left for the next section,
        which is dedicated to sentence cards.
      </p>
      <h3>How many cards should I learn a day?</h3>
      <p>
        We recommend learning between 10~20 cards a day. Keep in mind that the
        more new cards you learn a day, the more daily reviews you’ll have in
        the long term.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Should I do Recognition RTK and basic vocab at the same time?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We don’t recommend it. The ability to recognize kanji is a prerequisite
        to efficiently learning to read vocabulary. So, in the long run, it’s
        going to be more efficient to finish RRTK before starting Basic Vocab.
        Also, focusing on one thing at a time generally leads to more efficient
        learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, we do think it’s fine to do basic grammar and basic
        vocab at the same time, as long as you’ve finished RRTK. Just, if you
        plan on taking our recommendation of using both Tae Kim and the Tango N5
        deck, we highly recommend only reading through Tae Kim, and not making
        any SRS cards.
      </p>
      <h3>
        I keep forgetting the reading of kanji words, what should I do?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Even after finishing Recognition RTK, it’s common to have some
        difficulties remembering the reading of kanji words. After you learn to
        read a few hundred words, this should mostly go away. Remembering how
        kanji words are read is itself a skill, and you’re going to improve it
        by practicing. As you learn to read more words and get more comfortable
        with the Japanese sound system overall, remembering the readings of new
        words will get easier and easier.
      </p>
      <h3>What should I do about leeches?</h3>
      <p>
        In Anki, a “lapse” is when a learned card is graded “again”. When the
        same card lapses 5 times, Anki will mark it a “leech” and suspend the
        card. Leeches are a natural part of the learning process. Some things
        you learn will stick easily, some won’t stick no matter what you try,
        and most stuff will be somewhere in between. For those small minority of
        cards that just won’t stick, AKA leeches, it’s best to just get rid of
        them. Instead of wasting a bunch of time on a single leech, it’s more
        productive to learn 5 normal cards in its place.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the reason a card becomes a leech is due to a kanji reading just not
        sticking, feel free to put furigana for that word on the front of the
        card. To do this, copy the syntax from the “Reading” field into the
        “Expression” field.
      </p>
      <h2>The Rest of the Tango Series</h2>
      <p>
        The JLPT Tango N5 book is actually the first in a series of JLPT prep
        books. There are five books total, one for each level of the JLPT.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anything past the N5 book is beyond the scope of what MIA considers
        <em>basic vocab</em>. After reading through a grammar guide and learning
        the most common ~1000 words, you should be more than ready to start
        sentence mining, which will be discussed in a later section.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that said, we think it can be useful to go through the JLPT Tango
        N4 book as well, alongside starting sentence mining. We’ve made an Anki
        deck for the N4 book in a similar style as the N5 deck. Just like with
        the N5, if you submit the
        <a href="https://forms.gle/WBhbAxY2B6sgm16f8">N4 deck request form</a>,
        we’ll send you the deck.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don’t recommend going through N3 and beyond, and so we haven’t
        created Anki decks for those books.
      </p>
      <h1 id="sentence-cards">Sentence Cards</h1>
      <p>
        After completing basic grammar and basic vocab, the bulk of your active
        study will revolve around sentence cards until reaching basic fluency.
        In this section, we’ll explain what sentence cards actually are, and in
        the next section, we’ll explain how to make them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A sentence card is an SRS card with a target-language example sentence
        on the front, and whatever is needed to understand the sentence on the
        back. Often times, sentence cards are made using sentences taken
        directly from your own immersion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our opinion, sentence cards are the most effective way to use an SRS
        for vocabulary acquisition. We will explain exactly why we think this is
        below, but before moving on, we recommend watching the following video
        for more context. It explains how learning words with the SRS fits into
        the larger language acquisition process:

      <h2>Why Sentence Cards are Effective</h2>
      <p>
        In order to understand why sentence cards are effective, let’s start by
        thinking about what the goal of learning words actually is. Like we’ve
        been hinting at throughout this guide, in MIA, your first goal is to
        become able to
        <em>understand</em> real Japanese. If you can’t even understand
        Japanese, you’re not likely to have much luck with producing it
        yourself. On the other hand, once you do become able to understand real
        Japanese, with just a little practice, the ability to speak and write
        will come naturally.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, just like with grammar, our goal in learning words with the SRS is
        to increase our ability to understand Japanese. Because of this, the
        most effective SRS cards are those that allow us to actually practice
        <em>understanding Japanese</em>. This is precisely what a sentence card
        does.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to explore this idea more deeply, let’s compare sentence cards
        to another popular SRS card format: isolated vocab cards. The most
        common form of isolated vocab cards have a single target language word
        on the front, and its English meaning on the back. The main problem with
        this is that most Japanese words don’t have a true English equivalent.
        So, simply reading the English definition of a Japanese word won’t be
        enough to grasp what the word really means in context.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if you look up the Japanese word “暇”, the Japanese to
        English dictionary says it means, “spare time; free time; leisure”. But,
        this alone doesn’t really get across the reality of “暇”. On the other
        hand, if you made a sentence card with the sentence “いま暇ある？” on
        the front, and the English translation “Are you free right now?”, along
        with the English definition of “暇” on the back, that would give you a
        much better idea of how “暇” actually functions in Japanese.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another problem with isolated vocab cards is that many Japanese words
        have more than one meaning. For example, if you look up the Japanese
        word “<a href="https://jisho.org/search/%E3%81%8B%E3%81%91%E3%82%8B"
          >掛ける</a
        >” in the Japanese to English dictionary, the definition listed is
        comically long. Imagine making a flashcard with “掛ける” on the front,
        and that long list of possible meanings on the back. Not only would
        trying to recall all of those different meanings be a nightmare, but you
        still wouldn’t really understand what “掛ける” actually does in real
        Japanese.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if you made a sentence card with
        “眼鏡を<strong>掛ける</strong>” on the front, and the English
        translation “<strong>Put on</strong> glasses”, along with the English
        definition of “掛ける” on the back, that would at least give you a clear
        understanding of one of the meanings of “掛ける”. Then, if you also
        learned that the sentence “彼の肩に手を<strong>掛けた</strong>” meant
        “He <strong>placed</strong> a hand on his shoulder”, you may start to
        intuitively grasp what “掛ける” actually means.
      </p>
      <p>
        We could probably write thousands of more words on why sentence cards
        are effective, but for the sake of brevity, here is a bullet-point list
        of some of the additional benefits of sentence cards:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A sentence tells you not only what a word means, but how it’s used.
          Check out
          <a href="http://www.antimoon.com/how/examplesent.htm">this article</a>
          for a more in-depth explanation of this point.
        </li>
        <li>
          A sentence is a larger unit of meaning than an isolated word, so it’s
          much easier to understand sentences without
          <a href="https://youtu.be/CRmxNFv04ao">translating in your head</a>
          than isolated words.
        </li>
        <li>
          It’s easier to judge whether you understood a sentence than to judge
          whether you understood an isolated word.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sentences make things easier to remember. A sentence like “He felt
          happiness for the first time in a long while” leaves a much deeper and
          more meaningful impression than simply “to feel”. The more
          impressionable something is, the less likely you are to forget it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Because “reading and understanding a sentence” replicates how we use
          language in real life more than “recalling the meaning of an isolated
          word”, knowledge gained through sentence cards will transfer to actual
          ability more easily than knowledge gained through isolated vocab
          cards.
        </li>
        <li>
          Language is acquired through comprehending messages, so a sentence
          card makes it more likely that a word will actually be
          <em>acquired</em>, not just <em>learned</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h2>One-Target vs. Multi-Target Sentences</h2>
      <p>
        In order for a sentence card to be effective, it’s important that the
        sentence on the front be a one-target (1T) sentence. This means there’s
        only one unknown word or grammar structure being introduced in the
        sentence. You know a sentence is 1T when, after looking up or inferring
        the meaning of the unknown word/structure, the meaning of the entire
        sentence becomes clear.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a sentence is zero-target (0T), AKA, doesn’t contain anything you
        don’t already know, you won’t gain anything by making it into a sentence
        card. On the other hand, if a sentence is multi-target (MT), AKA,
        contains multiple words/structures you don’t already know, it’s going to
        be very difficult and frustrating to learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        Learning through 1T sentences can be thought of as “picking low hanging
        fruit”. It makes the target word/structure easy to understand and
        retain. As you continue to learn, sentences that previously were 1T will
        become 0T, and sentences that previously were MT will become 1T. In this
        way, 1T sentences can take you all the way to fluency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE</strong>: Previously, MIA referred to “1T sentences” as
        “i+1 sentences”. The term “i+1” comes from Stephen Krashen and his Input
        Hypothesis. From
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis">Wikipedia</a>:
        “[The Input Hypothesis] states that learners progress in their knowledge
        of the language when they comprehend language input that is slightly
        more advanced than their current level. Krashen called this level of
        input “i+1”, where “i” is the learner’s interlanguage and “+1″ is the
        next stage of language acquisition.” In other words, Krashen’s “i+1”
        refers to input that is immediately comprehensible to the unconscious
        language acquisition device. On the other hand, MIA was using the term
        to refer to input that could be consciously comprehended after looking
        up or inferring the meaning of an unknown word or structure. In order to
        avoid confusion due to this slight difference in meaning, we decided to
        drop the term and adopt the more straightforward “one target” instead.
      </p>
      <h2>Different Types of Sentence Cards</h2>
      <p>
        There are a few different types of sentence cards. The main categories
        are as follows:
      </p>
      <h3>Bilingual Sentence Card</h3>
      <p>
        A sentence card with a target language sentence on the front, and an
        English translation/definition on the back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you’re past the basic vocab phase,
        <strong
          >putting full English translations on the back of cards is not
          recommended</strong
        >. The reason for this is that English translations will always slightly
        differ from the original Japanese nuance. So, referencing an English
        translation can negatively bias the way your brain interprets the
        original Japanese. Thus, it’s best to stick to just putting the English
        definition of the target word/structure. If the sentence is 1T, that
        should be enough to understand it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bilingual sentence cards are used until the monolingual transition, at
        which point they are replaced by monolingual sentence cards.
      </p>
      <h3>Monolingual Sentence Card</h3>
      <p>
        A sentence card with a target language sentence on the front, and a
        monolingual definition of the target word/structure on the back. In
        other words, you’re using a monolingual dictionary created for native
        speakers of your target language (in the case of Japanese, a J-J
        dictionary).
      </p>
      <p>
        Monolingual cards are powerful because they allow you to learn your
        target language in your target language.
      </p>
      <h3>Text-based Sentence Card</h3>
      <p>
        A sentence card with a written sentence on the front, and whatever is
        needed to understand the sentence on the back. Could be monolingual or
        bilingual. In the case of Japanese, the sentence on the front should be
        full kanji with no furigana. Text-based sentence cards do not have any
        audio on the front of the card. It can be useful to have native audio
        for the sentence on the back of text-based sentence cards, but it is not
        necessary.
      </p>
      <h3>Audio-based Sentence Card</h3>
      <p>
        A sentence card with the native audio of a sentence on the front, and a
        written form of the sentence plus everything needed to understand it on
        the back. Could be monolingual or bilingual. Audio-based sentence cards
        do not have any text on the front of the card.
      </p>
      <h2>Text-based vs. Audio-based Sentence Cards</h2>
      <p>
        Both text-based and audio-based sentence cards have their own strengths
        and weaknesses.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength of text-based cards is that they’re great for training
        reading ability. The reason for this should be pretty self-explanatory:
        the cards have you actually <em>read</em> a sentence. The weakness of
        text-based cards is that they don’t translate into listening ability
        quite as well as audio-based cards. Just because you can read a word,
        that doesn’t guarantee that you will be able to successfully pick it out
        from native speech.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength and weakness of audio-based cards are just the opposite.
        Audio-based cards are great for training listening ability, as cards
        have you understand a spoken sentence. On the other hand, they don’t
        translate into reading ability as well, as they don’t actually test your
        ability to read the sentence. That said, with audio-based cards you do
        see the written form of the sentence on the back of the card, which does
        create reading ability benefits. In fact, many people report finding it
        much easier to learn to <em>read</em> a word they have an audio-based
        card for than it is to learn to <em>hear</em> a word they have a
        text-based card for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another difference between the two is that text-based cards are
        generally easier to make. All you need is the text for a sentence, so
        they can easily be made from things like webpages, tweets, YouTube
        comments, manga, novels or subtitles. On the other hand, audio-based
        cards require procuring audio files for sentences, which can be
        difficult. Also, with text-based cards, you can get away with being less
        strict about the 1T principle. This is because you can read the sentence
        as slow as you want, and take your time understanding the meaning. This
        allows you to push your limits a bit. On the other hand, audio has
        timing baked in. So, with audio-based cards, if you listen to the audio
        and can’t understand it, then you can’t understand it, and there isn’t
        much you can do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our recommendation is that, if you’re generally more focused on
        cultivating listening ability, try to make more audio-based cards. If
        you’re generally more focused on cultivating reading ability, try to
        make more text-based cards. With that said, you definitely don’t have to
        stick to either one or the other. We recommend making a combination of
        both, and getting a feel for which one you like more.
      </p>
      <h2>Reviewing Sentence Cards</h2>
      <p>
        When reviewing a sentence card, your job is to read/listen to the
        sentence and <em>understand</em> it. If it’s a text-based card, make
        sure you can also read all of the kanji in the sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        For text-based cards, you don’t have to read the sentence out loud, but
        you can if you want to. For audio-based cards, you don’t have to repeat
        the sentence out loud, but you can if you want to. For both text-based
        and audio-based cards, you don’t have to write out any part of the
        sentence, and we would recommend against doing so, as it would add too
        much time to your review sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do not try to translate the sentence into English. Try to actually
        understand it in Japanese (for tips on how to do this, check out
        <a href="https://youtu.be/CRmxNFv04ao">this video</a>. If you find
        yourself accidentally translating into English, that’s fine. Just don’t
        make an active effort to do so. Also, don’t try to recall the exact
        definition of the target word. Just focus on understanding the actual
        sentence, and getting a feel for what role the target word is playing in
        the sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don’t get caught up in understanding the sentence perfectly. If you feel
        like you pretty much get what’s going on, that’s good enough. That being
        said, get rid of any cards that confuse you, as they aren’t useful and
        make the reviewing process more frustrating.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you felt like you understood the sentence well, you don’t have to
        read the back of the card. Treat the back of the card as a reference,
        which you only refer to when necessary.
      </p>
      <h2>Grading Sentence Cards</h2>
      <p>
        In Anki, when you grade a card “good”, what’s really happening is that
        you’re telling Anki you want to see the card less often. When you grade
        a card “again”, you’re telling Anki you want to see the card more often.
        So, when grading cards, instead of asking yourself the question, “did I
        remember/understand it correctly?”, we think it’s more useful to ask,
        “would I benefit more from seeing this card more often?” If the answer
        is “no”, then grade the card “good”; if the answer is “yes”, then grade
        the card “again”.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that sometimes you might grade a card “good” even if you
        forgot part of it. For example, perhaps you just had a brain fart, or
        the reading of a word isn’t sticking no matter how many times you see
        it. In both of these cases, you probably wouldn’t benefit from seeing
        the card more often.
      </p>
      <p>
        We recommend sticking with the “good” and “again” buttons. The “hard”
        button in particular has counter-intuitive negative effects on Anki’s
        algorithm. To understand why this is, check out our article series on
        <nuxt-link to="/table-of-contents/anki/low-key-anki/intro/"
          >Low-Key Anki</nuxt-link
        >.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, don’t get too worked up about grading your cards correctly.
        Anki’s algorithm is pretty inexact anyway. Even if you occasionally
        grade a card poorly and end up forgetting it, nothing is really lost.
        You can always re-learn cards the next time they come up. Plus, in the
        grand scheme of things, you can always trust immersion to fill in any
        important gaps in your knowledge.
      </p>
      <h1 id="sentence-mining">Sentence Mining</h1>
      <p>
        Sentence mining is the process of finding 1T sentences in your immersion
        and making them into sentence cards. Sentence mining is extremely
        powerful because it integrates study with immersion, guaranteeing that
        you’re always learning what’s most relevant to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below, we’ll explore a few different ways of going about sentence
        mining. Some are simple, and others are more complicated. We recommend
        experimenting with different methods until you find a sentence mining
        workflow that works well for you. Feel free to get creative! Also, if
        some of the complicated methods sound intimidating, feel free to ignore
        them and stick with the straight forward ones. What method you use
        doesn’t really matter; what really matters is that you’re creating Anki
        cards out of sentences from your immersion.
      </p>
      <h2>Basic Sentence Mining</h2>
      <p>
        Its essence, sentence mining is extremely simple. Just spot a 1T
        sentence in your immersion, copy/paste or manually type it into an Anki
        card, look up the target word in an online dictionary, and copy/paste it
        onto the back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matt and Yoga used variations of this basic technique for the entirety
        of their Japanese learning career. They had great success with it, and
        many others have as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some tips for getting the most out of this style of sentence
        mining:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          While immersing, copy all of the potential 1T sentences you find into
          a text file. Later, turn the sentences you collected into Anki cards
          in bulk. This way, you don’t have to constantly interrupt the flow of
          your immersion.
        </li>
        <li>
          When immersing with things like video games and manga, take pictures
          of potential 1T sentences with your phone, and then transcribe them
          later in bulk.
        </li>
        <li>
          E-readers like
          <a href="https://youtu.be/1CrlQHA9i0g">Kindle</a>
          let you easily highlight and save sentences while reading, which you
          can then export to your computer for card making.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://youtu.be/IS7WzYICAsk">ShareX</a>
          allows you to easily record short segments of audio in real-time. This
          is useful for audio-based sentence cards.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When using this sort of approach to sentence mining, don’t think of
        “normal immersion” and “finding 1T sentences” as two separate
        activities. Rather, whenever you’re immersing in Japanese, be on the
        lookout for potential 1T sentences to mine. That said, as was mentioned
        above, we do recommend dedicating a separate period of time to
        <em>creating</em> cards out of the sentences you’ve collected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you’ve hit your sentence quota for the day, you can stop collecting
        new sentences. With that being said, avoid falling into the trap of
        using this as an excuse to not pay attention to your immersion.
      </p>
      <h2>Subs2SRS</h2>
      <p>
        You can get a little more technical with your sentence mining by
        introducing the program
        <a href="http://subs2srs.sourceforge.net/">subs2srs</a>. Subs2srs is a
        program that lets you make Anki decks out of video and subtitle files.
        For example, if you had a Japanese movie and the accompanying Japanese
        subtitle file, you could use subs2srs to automatically create an Anki
        deck with one card for each subtitle line, along with the corresponding
        audio and snapshot.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is extremely powerful because it opens up the possibility of making
        large amounts of high quality, original sentence cards extremely
        quickly. It also allows you to have native audio on all of your cards,
        which is extremely useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        The downside of subs2srs is that in order to use it, you need to acquire
        the file for the show/movie you want to use, along with a correctly
        timed subtitle file for that show/movie. This can often be quite
        difficult. One way to go about this is with
        <a href="#netflix">Netflix</a>, as was mentioned in the immersion
        section.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can find a step-by-step tutorial for creating subs2srs decks
        <a href="https://youtu.be/4AvgqVGHP8A">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most methods of working with subs2srs involve creating a sentence bank.
        The following video by BritVsJapan explains the idea in detail:
      </p>
      <YouTubeEmbed src="https://youtube.com/embed/kCsxLyALIgk" />

      <h2 id="morphman">MorphMan</h2>

        Subs2srs can become even more powerful when combined with
        <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/900801631" target="_blank"
          >MorphMan</a
        >. MorphMan is an Anki add-on that keeps track of what words you know,
        and uses that to reorder your new cards into the optimal order.
        Basically, you can have MorphMan go through your subs2srs bank and find
        1T sentences for you, saving you the time you would have had to spend
        going through it yourself.

      <h2>Sentence Mining Q&amp;A</h2>
      <h3>How many cards should I learn a day?</h3>
      <p>
        One way to think about it is the following. Think about many hours you
        want to spend actively working on Japanese each day. Aim to spend one
        third of that time on Anki, one third actively listening, and one third
        reading or watching with Japanese subtitles. For example, if you plan on
        spending 3 hours a day actively working on Japanese, aim to spend 1 of
        those hours on Anki. This includes both creating and reviewing cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you know how long you want to spend on Anki each day, you can use
        the
        <a href="https://pheartheceal.github.io/anki-optimizer/" target="_blank"
          >Anki simulator</a
        >‘s “New Cards Calculator” to calculate how the maximum number of new
        cards you can learn each day without exceeding your desired amount of
        time. For our example, let’s say you spend 15 minutes making new cards
        and 45 minutes reviewing. According to the new card calculator, that
        means you should be able to learn 11 cards a day without ever exceeding
        45 minutes of review time per day.
      </p>
      <p>
        No matter how much time you have, it may be a good idea to start with
        something like 10 cards a day, and see how that feels. If you feel like
        you can handle more, you can begin slowly increasing your amount of
        daily cards. That being said, we don’t recommend ever exceeding 30 cards
        per day, regardless of how much time you have available. For the
        quickest progress, use any remaining time you have on extra immersion.
      </p>
      <p>
        It’s important to remember that
        <strong
          >immersion is the most important component of the language acquisition
          process, and the SRS is simply a supplement to that</strong
        >. Any time spent on the SRS is time <em>not</em> spent on immersion, so
        it’s a good idea to be conservative when deciding how many new cards to
        learn each day.
      </p>
      <h3>
        What should I do when I find a word I want to learn, but don’t have
        access to the original sentence I found it in?
      </h3>
      <p>
        In general, it’s best to learn words in the original sentence you found
        it in. But, sometimes this isn’t possible, due to the original sentence
        not being 1T, or you simply not having access to it. In cases like
        these, consider simply dropping the word and moving on; it will come up
        again in your immersion sooner or later. But, if you really want to
        learn the word, you can try to find an alternate 1T sentence.
      </p>
      <p>You have a few options:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          If you have a subs2srs sentence bank, search your bank.
        </li>
        <li>
          Google the word and scroll through random Japanese pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          Search the word on Twitter and scroll through random Japanese tweets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Check an online Japanese dictionary for example sentences (you can
          find a list of dictionaries in the next section).
        </li>
        <li>
          Search one of the following Japanese example sentence websites:
          <a href="http://yourei.jp/" target="_blank">Yourei</a>,

      <h3>
        I want to sentence mine a TV show but I can’t find subtitles for it.
        What should I do?
      </h3>
      <p>
        In cases like this, it’s best to simply give up and find a better source
        to mine from. Unless you’re already at an advanced level, we strongly
        advise against attempting to transcribe apparent 1T sentences from the
        show yourself. You can still watch the show, but just don’t try to mine
        from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you catch a word while listening that you want to add to Anki, try
        finding a new 1T sentence using one of the resources listed above.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Sometimes sentences look like they’re 1T, but after looking up the
        target word, I still don’t understand it.
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is completely normal. Just because a sentence
        <em>looks</em> 1T, that doesn’t mean it really is. It could be that the
        sentence in question also uses a grammar structure you aren’t familiar
        with yet, or that one of the other words is being used in a different
        way than you’re used to. Whenever this happens, immediately drop the
        sentence and move on. You should be looking for
        <em>low hanging fruit</em>, AKA, sentences that <em>click</em> as soon
        as you look up the target word. It’s through these sentences that your
        ability grows. So, don’t waste any time trying to figure out a sentence
        that’s not clicking.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, expect around <em>two thirds</em> of the apparent 1T
        sentence you find to still not make sense after looking up the target
        word. This means that if you’re taking the approach of collecting
        sentences while immersing and then making cards later in bulk, aim to
        collect 3 times as many sentences as you plan on adding to Anki. This
        way, you will be able to afford only keeping the true low hanging fruit.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Should I make cards for things I picked up naturally from immersion?
      </h3>
      <p>
        In general, no. You only have time to make so many new cards each day,
        so you want to make sure you get as much value as possible out of each
        card you make. If you feel like you might be able to remember a word
        without making a card, then don’t make a card. If it turns out that you
        were wrong and you end up forgetting it, it’s never too late to make a
        card later. As a general principle, always lean towards the side of
        making less rather than more cards.
      </p>
      <h3>
        If a card has multiple meanings, should I make a separate card for each
        meaning?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Usually not. Normally, once you know one meaning of a word, remembering
        its other meanings isn’t too difficult. So, when you first learn a word,
        just focus on whatever specific usage is relevant for the sentence you
        found the word in. Then, try to pick up the other meanings over time
        through immersion. It’s ok to make exceptions to this rule if a word has
        two or more radically different usages. But even in those cases, try to
        only learn one usage at a time in order to avoid confusion.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Every day I find more 1T sentences than I need. How do I choose which
        ones to turn into cards?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Ultimately, it doesn’t really matter. In human language, common words
        are used exponentially more than uncommon words. So, most of the unknown
        words you come across are going to be common, and therefore worth
        learning. You may end up learning an uncommon word here and there, but
        that’s not going to hurt you; you’re going to end up learning all of
        those words sooner or later anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don’t need to worry about using frequency lists to measure the value
        of unknown words until you’ve reached an advanced level. Until then,
        it’s best to let your interests guide you. Always pick the sentences
        that look the most intriguing and memorable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another good rule of thumb is to learn words you feel like you’ve seen
        before. If you feel like you’ve seen a word before, that probably means
        you’ve come across it many times in your immersion, and your brain is
        already primed to learn it. It also means that it must be common and
        high yield.
      </p>
      <h3>How long should sentences be?</h3>
      <p>
        There are no strict rules, but sentence cards are likely to be most
        effective when the sentence is between 3 and 7 words long. Too short,
        and you won’t have enough context for the sentence to be meaningful. Too
        long, and it will be a pain to review the card. Over time, you’ll get a
        feel for the ideal sentence length as you continue to create and review
        sentence cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        We will also note that it’s perfectly fine to make cards out of
        fragments of longer sentences. Just make sure what you have on the front
        of your card is a complete clause.
      </p>
      <h3>Should I put a picture/screenshot on my cards?</h3>
      <p>
        We don’t recommend putting a picture on the front of any of your
        sentence cards. For maximum effectiveness, you want the SRS to reflect
        real life as much as possible. In real life a picture isn’t going to be
        there to remind you what the word means, so you don’t want it on the
        front of your card either.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that said, it can be useful to have images on the back of cards.
        This is especially true for nouns. For example, when learning the word
        for a particular hair style, a picture is going to be much more useful
        than a written description.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you feel that a picture would help you understand a target word, try
        searching Google Images. That said, finding a picture and adding it to a
        card takes time, so don’t feel like you need to find a picture for every
        card. For subs2srs decks that come with screenshots, we recommend
        keeping the screenshots, but having them appear on the back of cards.
      </p>
      <h3>
        When making cards, should I go out of my way to kanjify words?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Some words, such as “ある” and “いる”, can be written in kanji (“有る”,
        “居る”), but are usually written in kana. If you mine a sentence with a
        word that can be written in kanji, but isn’t, it can be a good idea to
        manually convert it to kanji while making the card. The reason for this
        is that if you can read a word’s kanji, you will definitely be able to
        read it in kana as well. On the other hand, just because you can
        understand a word when it’s written in kana, that doesn’t guarentee
        you’ll be able to read its kanji. In other words, better safe than
        sorry.
      </p>
      <p>
        With that being said, there’s no need to kanjify words you already know
        well. For example, it might be a good idea to kanjify “いる” the first
        couple times you make a sentence card that contains it. But, after that,
        you can just keep “いる” as kana for the rest of the cards you make.
      </p>
      <h3>What should I do about leeches?</h3>
      <p>
        In Anki, a “lapse” is when a learned card is graded “again”. When the
        same card lapses 5 times, Anki will mark it a “leech” and suspend the
        card. Leeches are a natural part of the learning process. Some things
        you learn will stick easily, some won’t stick no matter what you try,
        and most stuff will be somewhere in between.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those small minority of cards that just won’t stick, AKA, leeches,
        it’s best to just get rid of them. Instead of wasting a bunch of time on
        a single leech, it’s more productive to learn 5 normal cards in its
        place. As long as you keep immersing, it’s inevitable that you’ll pick
        up those stubborn words sooner or later.
      </p>
      <h3>
        While reviewing, often times I feel like I have simply memorized the
        sentence, and still don’t know the target word.
      </h3>
      <p>
        That’s totally fine. As long as you’ve memorized the sentence (and what
        it means), then, in a sense, you’ve necessarily memorized the target
        word as well. When you come across that word in your immersion, just try
        to recall the original sentence you learned the word in, and you should
        be able to recall the meaning of the word as well. This also connects
        with the next question.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Sometimes I can’t remember the meaning/reading of a word while
        immersing, even though I have a sentence card for it.
      </h3>
      <p>
        This is a normal and inevitable part of the learning process. To learn
        more about why this happens and how to deal with it, watch
        <a href="https://youtu.be/wrBFhsnBQ2k" target="_blank">this video</a>
        (which was linked at the start of the previous section).
      </p>
      <h3>
        So…… I just keep immersing and making sentence cards? That’s it?!
      </h3>
      <p>
        Yup! As explained in the immersion section, active immersion alone is
        enough to take you to fluency; the SRS is just a way of accelerating
        that process. Through regularly getting passive and active immersion and
        consistently creating sentence cards, your Japanese comprehension should
        continue to steadily grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        After making a couple thousand bilingual sentence cards, we recommend
        making the
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AH2JmxglzU" target="_blank"
          >monolingual transition</a
        >
        and switching to making monolingual sentence cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have a strong foundation in Japanese and can comfortably
        function monolingually, we recommend beginning to study pitch accent and
        general Japanese phonetics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you start being able to comprehend around 80% of your immersion
        content, you should find that you start feeling ready to start speaking
        naturally. Once that time comes, you can start applying some of the
        techniques Matt talked about in his
        <a href="https://youtu.be/YCESUUA0wL0" target="_blank"
          >How to Start Outputting</a
        >
        video. And that should take you to a high level of Japanese fluency.
      </p>

      <h2>Combining Sentence Mining with Pre-Made Decks</h2>
      <p>
        In the section on basic grammar, the option of going through the Tango
        N4 deck alongside sentence mining was discussed. Although we strongly
        advise against learning strictly from pre-made material, some people
        might find it useful to continue this approach of supplementing sentence
        mining with pre-made decks.
      </p>
      <p>
        As mentioned in the basic grammar section, we don’t recommend above N4
        in the JLPT Tango series. Instead, we consider either a
        <a href="http://rtkwiki.koohii.com/wiki/Core_10k" target="_blank"
          >Core 10k</a
        >
        deck or Dictionary of Japanese Grammar deck to be a better choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing is, if you’re sentence mining and immersing, you’re going to
        end up already knowing a lot of the content in those decks. This means
        that going through them from start to finish would be extremely
        redundant. Because of this, supplementing sentence mining with pre-made
        decks pretty much requires the use of
        <a href="#morphman" target="_blank">MorphMan</a>. MorphMan will help you
        find new content in the pre-made deck that’s 1T for you given your
        current knowledge. This way, you can, for example, learn 10 mined
        sentences and 5 pre-made sentences each day. On days that you’re tight
        on time and can’t make your own cards, you could rely more heavily on
        the pre-made decks.
      </p>
      <p>
        We should note that this sort of approach is completely optional.&nbsp;
        Matt and Yoga just stuck with sentence mining, and it worked out very
        well for them.
